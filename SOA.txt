A group of European experts reappraised the guidelines on the therapeutic 
efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) previously 
published in 2014 [Lefaucheur et al., Clin Neurophysiol 2014;125:2150-206]. 
These updated recommendations take into account all rTMS publications, including 
data prior to 2014, as well as currently reviewed literature until the end of 
2018. Level A evidence (definite efficacy) was reached for: high-frequency (HF) 
rTMS of the primary motor cortex (M1) contralateral to the painful side for 
neuropathic pain; HF-rTMS of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) 
using a figure-of-8 or a H1-coil for depression; low-frequency (LF) rTMS of 
contralesional M1 for hand motor recovery in the post-acute stage of stroke. 
Level B evidence (probable efficacy) was reached for: HF-rTMS of the left M1 or 
DLPFC for improving quality of life or pain, respectively, in fibromyalgia; 
HF-rTMS of bilateral M1 regions or the left DLPFC for improving motor impairment 
or depression, respectively, in Parkinson's disease; HF-rTMS of ipsilesional M1 
for promoting motor recovery at the post-acute stage of stroke; intermittent 
theta burst stimulation targeted to the leg motor cortex for lower limb 
spasticity in multiple sclerosis; HF-rTMS of the right DLPFC in posttraumatic 
stress disorder; LF-rTMS of the right inferior frontal gyrus in chronic 
post-stroke non-fluent aphasia; LF-rTMS of the right DLPFC in depression; and 
bihemispheric stimulation of the DLPFC combining right-sided LF-rTMS (or 
continuous theta burst stimulation) and left-sided HF-rTMS (or intermittent 
theta burst stimulation) in depression. Level A/B evidence is not reached 
concerning efficacy of rTMS in any other condition. The current recommendations 
are based on the differences reached in therapeutic efficacy of real vs. sham 
rTMS protocols, replicated in a sufficient number of independent studies. This 
does not mean that the benefit produced by rTMS inevitably reaches a level of 
clinical relevance.

Neuropathic pain remains a significant unmet medical need. Several 
recommendations have recently been proposed concerning pharmacotherapy, 
neurostimulation techniques and interventional management, but no comprehensive 
guideline encompassing all these treatments has yet been issued. We performed a 
systematic review of pharmacotherapy, neurostimulation, surgery, psychotherapies 
and other types of therapy for peripheral or central neuropathic pain, based on 
studies published in peer-reviewed journals before January 2018. The main 
inclusion criteria were chronic neuropathic pain for at least three months, a 
randomized controlled methodology, at least three weeks of follow-up, at least 
10 patients per group, and a double-blind design for drug therapy. Based on the 
GRADE system, we provide weak-to-strong recommendations for use and proposal as 
a first-line treatment for SNRIs (duloxetine and venlafaxine), gabapentin and 
tricyclic antidepressants and, for topical lidocaine and transcutaneous 
electrical nerve stimulation specifically for peripheral neuropathic pain; a 
weak recommendation for use and proposal as a second-line treatment for 
pregabalin, tramadol, combination therapy (antidepressant combined with 
gabapentinoids), and for high-concentration capsaicin patches and botulinum 
toxin A specifically for peripheral neuropathic pain; a weak recommendation for 
use and proposal as a third-line treatment for high-frequency rTMS of the motor 
cortex, spinal cord stimulation (failed back surgery syndrome and painful 
diabetic polyneuropathy) and strong opioids (in the absence of an alternative). 
Psychotherapy (cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness) is recommended as a 
second-line therapy, as an add-on to other therapies. An algorithm encompassing 
all the recommended treatments is proposed.

Dyspepsia is a complex of symptoms referable to the gastroduodenal region of the 
gastrointestinal tract and includes epigastric pain or burning, postprandial 
fullness, or early satiety. Approximately 80% of individuals with dyspepsia have 
no structural explanation for their symptoms and have functional dyspepsia. 
Functional dyspepsia affects up to 16% of otherwise healthy individuals in the 
general population. Risk factors include psychological comorbidity, acute 
gastroenteritis, female sex, smoking, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs, and Helicobacter pylori infection. The pathophysiology remains 
incompletely understood, but it is probably related to disordered communication 
between the gut and the brain, leading to motility disturbances, visceral 
hypersensitivity, and alterations in gastrointestinal microbiota, mucosal and 
immune function, and CNS processing. Although technically a normal endoscopy is 
required to diagnose functional dyspepsia, the utility of endoscopy in all 
patients with typical symptoms is minimal; its use should be restricted to 
people aged 55 years and older, or to those with concerning features, such as 
weight loss or vomiting. As a result of our incomplete understanding of its 
pathophysiology, functional dyspepsia is difficult to treat and, in most 
patients, the condition is chronic and the natural history is one of fluctuating 
symptoms. Eradication therapy should be offered to patients with functional 
dyspepsia who test positive for Helicobacter pylori. Other therapies with 
evidence of effectiveness include proton pump inhibitors, histamine-2 receptor 
antagonists, prokinetics, and central neuromodulators. The role of psychological 
therapies is uncertain. As our understanding of the pathophysiology of 
functional dyspepsia increases, it is probable that the next decade will see the 
emergence of truly disease-modifying therapies for the first time.

INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of amputation and post-amputation pain (PAP) is 
rising. There are two main types of PAP: residual limb pain (RLP) and phantom 
limb pain (PLP), with an estimated 95% of people with amputations experiencing 
one or both. Medical Management: The majority of chronic PAP is due to phantom 
limb pain, which is neurogenic in nature. Common medications used include 
tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, and opioids. Newer studies are evaluating 
alternative drugs such as ketamine and local anesthetics. Rehabilitation 
Management: Mirror visual feedback and cognitive behavioral therapy are often 
effective adjunct therapies and have minimal adverse effects. Surgical 
Management: Neuromodulatory treatment and surgery for neuromas have been found 
to help select patients with PAP.
CONCLUSION: PAP is a complex condition with mechanisms that can be located at 
the residual limb, spinal cord, and brain - or a combination. This complex pain 
can be difficult to treat. The mainstays of treatment are largely medical, but 
several surgical options are also being studied.

BACKGROUND: Spinal cord stimulation has been an established treatment for 
chronic back and leg pain for more than 50 years; however, outcomes are variable 
and unpredictable, and objective evidence of the mechanism of action is needed. 
A novel spinal cord stimulation system provides the first in vivo, real-time, 
continuous objective measure of spinal cord activation in response to therapy 
via recorded evoked compound action potentials (ECAPs) in patients during daily 
use. These ECAPs are also used to optimise programming and deliver closed-loop 
spinal cord stimulation by adjusting the stimulation current to maintain 
activation within patients' therapeutic window. We aimed to examine pain relief 
and the extent of spinal cord activation with ECAP-controlled closed-loop versus 
fixed-output, open-loop spinal cord stimulation for the treatment of chronic 
back and leg pain.
METHODS: This multicentre, double-blind, parallel-arm, randomised controlled 
trial was done at 13 specialist clinics, academic centres, and hospitals in the 
USA. Patients with chronic, intractable pain of the back and legs (Visual Analog 
Scale [VAS] pain score ≥60 mm; Oswestry Disability Index [ODI] score 41-80) who 
were refractory to conservative therapy, on stable pain medications, had no 
previous experience with spinal cord stimulation, and were appropriate 
candidates for a spinal cord stimulation trial were screened. Eligible patients 
were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive ECAP-controlled closed-loop spinal cord 
stimulation (investigational group) or fixed-output, open-loop spinal cord 
stimulation (control group). The randomisation sequence was computer generated 
with permuted blocks of size 4 and 6 and stratified by site. Patients, 
investigators, and site staff were masked to the treatment assignment. The 
primary outcome was the proportion of patients with a reduction of 50% or more 
in overall back and leg pain with no increase in pain medications. 
Non-inferiority (δ=10%) followed by superiority were tested in the 
intention-to-treat population at 3 months (primary analysis) and 12 months 
(additional prespecified analysis) after the permanent implant. This study is 
registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02924129, and is ongoing.
FINDINGS: Between Feb 21, 2017, and Feb 20, 2018, 134 patients were enrolled and 
randomly assigned (67 to each treatment group). The intention-to-treat analysis 
comprised 125 patients at 3 months (62 in the closed-loop group and 63 in the 
open-loop group) and 118 patients at 12 months (59 in the closed-loop group and 
59 in the open-loop group). The primary outcome was achieved in a greater 
proportion of patients in the closed-loop group than in the open-loop group at 3 
months (51 [82·3%] of 62 patients vs 38 [60·3%] of 63 patients; difference 
21·9%, 95% CI 6·6-37·3; p=0·0052) and at 12 months (49 [83·1%] of 59 patients vs 
36 [61·0%] of 59 patients; difference 22·0%, 6·3-37·7; p=0·0060). We observed no 
differences in safety profiles between the two groups. The most frequently 
reported study-related adverse events in both groups were lead migration (nine 
[7%] patients), implantable pulse generator pocket pain (five [4%]), and muscle 
spasm or cramp (three [2%]).
INTERPRETATION: ECAP-controlled closed-loop stimulation provided significantly 
greater and more clinically meaningful pain relief up to 12 months than 
open-loop spinal cord stimulation. Greater spinal cord activation seen in the 
closed-loop group suggests a mechanistic explanation for the superior results, 
which aligns with the putative mechanism of action for spinal cord stimulation 
and warrants further investigation.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Urologic chronic pelvic pain syndrome (UCPPS) is a chronic, 
noncyclic pain condition which can lead to significant patient morbidity and 
disability. It is defined by pain in the pelvic region, lasting for greater than 
3 to 6 months, with no readily identifiable disease process. The aim of this 
review is to provide a comprehensive update of diagnosis and treatment of UCPPS.
RECENT FINDINGS: UCPPS encompasses chronic pelvic pain syndrome or chronic 
prostatitis (CP/CPPS) in men and interstitial cystitis or painful bladder 
syndrome (IC/PBS) in women. Underlying inflammatory, immunologic, and 
neuropathic components have been implicated in the pathogenesis of UCPPS. For 
optimal patient management, an individualized and multimodal approach is 
recommended. Medical management and physical therapy are the mainstays of 
treatment. Injection therapy may offer additional relief in medically refractory 
patients. Further minimally invasive management may include spinal cord and 
peripheral nerve stimulation, though evidence supporting efficacy is limited.

Gut-brain dysregulation has been recognized by the scientific community as being 
crucial to the understanding of chronic gastrointestinal conditions, and this 
has translated into the practice of a newly established discipline, 
psychogastroenterology. Along with psychotherapy, antidepressants (a subtype of 
central neuromodulators) have been proposed as treatments for gut-brain 
disorders that might benefit both psychological and gastrointestinal health. 
Antidepressants have been found to be effective for the treatment of comorbid 
anxiety and depression, pain and impaired sleep. Although the efficacy of 
antidepressants is well established in disorders of gut-brain interaction 
(DGBI), evidence is only now emerging in IBD. This Perspective discusses the use 
of antidepressants in DGBI and IBD, focusing on how what we have learnt about 
the role of antidepressants in DGBI could be applied to help optimize the 
management of IBD.

Objectives: This pilot study aimed to compare the efficacy of manual pressure 
release (MPR), strain counterstrain (SCS), and integrated neuromuscular 
inhibition technique (INIT) in the management of chronic nonspecific low back 
pain (LBP). Design: Single-blind, randomized, controlled pilot trial. Setting: 
Neurosurgery clinic. Subjects: Forty-eight patients (46 women; mean age, 
35.47 ± 10.58 years) diagnosed chronic nonspecific LBP and who had at least one 
active myofascial trigger point (MTrP) in the quadratus lumborum, iliocostalis 
lumborum, gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, and gluteus minimus muscles were 
included. Interventions: Patients received a standard home exercise program in 
addition to the MPR technique (MPR group), SCS technique (SCS group), and INIT 
(INIT group) for 12 sessions (2 days/week for 6 weeks). Outcome measures: The 
primary outcome was the visual analog scale (VAS). The secondary outcomes were 
MTrP examination, pressure pain threshold, lumbar active range of motion, 
Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Beck depression inventory, and state-trait 
anxiety inventory. Results: There is no significant difference in terms of the 
percentage of deactivated MTrPs after 1st session and 12th session between 
groups (p > 0.05), but the percentage of deactivated MTrPs was less in MPR group 
than other groups. The overall group-by-time interaction for the repeated 
measures analysis of variance was not significant for primary and secondary 
outcomes (p > 0.05), but the improvement in the VAS-activity and the ODI was 
slightly better in the SCS group compared with other groups. Conclusions: These 
preliminary findings, which might help provide a glimpse into the clinical 
effectiveness of three manual therapy techniques (MPR, SCS, and INIT) rather 
than statistical significance, indicated that SCS or INIT might provide slightly 
better improvement in pain during activity, deactivation of MTrPs, and 
disability related to pain in chronic nonspecific LBP.

INTRODUCTION: Peripheral neuropathic pain (PNP) is defined as the neuropathic 
pain that arises either acutely or in the chronic phase of a lesion or disease 
affecting the peripheral nervous system. PNP is associated with a remarkable 
disease burden, and there is an increasing demand for new therapies to be used 
in isolation or combination with currently available treatments. The aim of this 
systematic review was to evaluate the current evidence, derived from randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) that assess non-pharmacological interventions for the 
treatment of PNP.
METHODS: After a systematic Medline search, we identified 18 papers eligible to 
be included.
RESULTS: The currently best available evidence (level II of evidence) exist for 
painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy. In particular, spinal cord stimulation 
as adjuvant to conventional medical treatment can be effectively used for the 
management of patients with refractory pain. Similarly, adjuvant repetitive 
transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex is effective in reducing 
the overall pain intensity, whereas adjuvant static magnetic field therapy can 
lead to a significant decrease in exercise-induced pain. Weaker evidence (level 
III of evidence) exists for the use of acupuncture as a monotherapy and 
neurofeedback, either as an add-on or a monotherapy approach, for treatment of 
painful chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy CONCLUSIONS: Future RCTs 
should be conducted to shed more light in the use of non-pharmacological 
approaches in patients with PNP.

BACKGROUND: Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is an established treatment for 
chronic neuropathic, neuropathic-like and ischaemic pain. However, the 
heterogeneity of patients in daily clinical practice makes it often challenging 
to determine which patients are eligible for this treatment, resulting in 
undesirable practice variations. This study aimed to establish patient-specific 
recommendations for referral and selection of SCS in chronic pain.
METHODS: A multidisciplinary European panel used the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness 
Method (RUAM) to assess the appropriateness of (referral for) SCS for 386 
clinical scenarios in four pain areas: chronic low back pain and/or leg pain, 
complex regional pain syndrome, neuropathic pain syndromes and ischaemic pain 
syndromes. In addition, the panel identified a set of psychosocial factors that 
are relevant to the decision for SCS treatment.
RESULTS: Appropriateness of SCS was strongly determined by the neuropathic or 
neuropathic-like pain component, location and spread of pain, anatomic 
abnormalities and previous response to therapies targeting pain processing (e.g. 
nerve block). Psychosocial factors considered relevant for SCS selection were as 
follows: lack of engagement, dysfunctional coping, unrealistic expectations, 
inadequate daily activity level, problematic social support, secondary gain, 
psychological distress and unwillingness to reduce high-dose opioids. An 
educational e-health tool was developed that combines clinical and psychosocial 
factors into an advice on referral/selection for SCS.
CONCLUSIONS: The RUAM was useful to establish a consensus on patient-specific 
criteria for referral/selection for SCS in chronic pain. The e-health tool may 
help physicians learn to apply an integrated approach of clinical and 
psychosocial factors.
SIGNIFICANCE: Determining the eligibility of SCS in patients with chronic pain 
requires careful consideration of a variety of clinical and psychosocial 
factors. Using a systematic approach to combine evidence from clinical studies 
and expert opinion, a multidisciplinary European expert panel developed detailed 
recommendations to support appropriate referral and selection for SCS in chronic 
pain. These recommendations are available as an educational e-health tool 
(https://www.scstool.org/).

OBJECTIVES: To describe the state of the literature for clinical effectiveness 
of neurostimulation used for the management of chronic pain.
METHODS: A systematic review of spinal cord stimulation (SCS), peripheral nerve 
stimulation (PNS), peripheral nerve field stimulation (PNFS), and supraorbital 
transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation in patients with cancer and 
noncancer chronic pain was conducted. MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and the Cochrane 
CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials were searched, using terms like 
"electrical stimulation therapy" and "pain management." Direction of effect, 
consistency across studies, and strength of evidence for effects of 
neurostimulation on chronic pain were narratively synthesized.
RESULTS: A total of 15 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining SCS, 7 RCTs 
examining PNS/PNFS, and 1 nonrandomized trial examining supraorbital 
transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) were included. In nine SCS 
studies, neurostimulation had positive effects on pain. In three studies, 
neurostimulation did not significantly reduce pain. For PNS/PNFS, five studies 
found improvements in pain offered by neurostimulation; pain outcomes were not 
reported in two studies. In the TENS study, neurostimulation reduced headaches 
per month and medication consumption. Overall, 21 studies were of low or unclear 
risk of bias, 4 were high risk of bias, and the TENS study was not appropriate 
for assessment using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool.
CONCLUSIONS: A robust body of evidence examining SCS and PNS was identified. 
Only one study for PNFS and TENS was identified; both reported pain reductions. 
Generally, neurostimulation improved pain control. Future studies should examine 
the effectiveness of neurostimulation offered early in the trajectory of chronic 
pain.

Functional movement disorders (FMD) are commonly seen in neurologic practice and 
frequent sources of disability. Patients may present with tremor, weakness, 
dystonia, jerking movements, abnormal gait and speech, often combining several 
movement phenomenologies. Associated symptoms include chronic pain, depression, 
and anxiety. Treatment of FMD begins with an explanation of the diagnosis and 
needs to be tailored to patients' symptoms and comorbidities. There may be 
benefit from multidisciplinary treatment, including physical, occupational, and 
speech therapy, as well as psychotherapeutic interventions, especially cognitive 
behavior therapy. The role for neuromodulation such as transmagnetic stimulation 
in FMD treatment requires further research.

The Challenge of Basic Itch Research.

Carstens E, Follansbee T, Iodi Carstens M.

Basic mechanisms and pathways of itch signaling are reviewed, with an emphasis 
on the progress to date as well as remaining challenges in translating current 
knowledge to the clinical treatment of chronic itch. Recent studies reveal 3 
subsets of pruriceptive sensory neurons highly expressing itch-related genes. 
Their fibers project into the spinal cord to activate neurons expressing gastrin 
releasing peptide (GRP) and its receptor (GRPR), which connect to neurons that 
express the substance P (NK-1) receptor and project to the parabrachial nucleus 
and thalamus. Spinal inhibitory interneurons release GABA, glycine and dynorphin 
to modulate segmental itch transmission. However, near-ly all pruriceptive 
neurons also respond to algogens such as capsaicin. Alternative theories of 
itch-pain discrimination, such as intensity or spatial contrast, are based on 
the observation that focal stimulation of nociceptive nerve endings elicits itch 
while more wide-spread stimulation elicits pain. These findings cloud the issue 
of a labeled line for itch- a long-debated but currently unresolved challenge. 
In higher primates there is a dichotomy of histaminergic and non-histaminergic 
itch-signaling pathways which is less demarcated in rodents, suggesting species 
differences. A cardinal symptom of chronic itch is alloknesis, i.e., mechanical 
or touch-evoked itch. Recent evidence indicates that low-threshold 
mechanosensory afferents can access the spinal itch pathway, but are normally 
kept in check by inhibitory interneurons expressing neuropeptide Y (NPY). In 
chronic itch, NPY-mediated inhibition is reduced, allowing touch to excite 
itch-signaling pathways. These recent advances provide novel targets for 
development of therapeutic strategies to relieve chronic itch.

The management of pain in persons with neurological injuries is challenging and 
complex. A holistic view and clinical approach are necessary when addressing 
pain in patients with neurological impairment because interpreting signs and 
symptoms and deciphering sources of pain is never a straightforward process. 
This problem is further magnified with the management of central pain syndromes. 
The best approach is to have a good understanding of the clinical 
characteristics commonly found in this patient population, in particular for 
patients with stroke, multiple sclerosis (MS), or spinal cord injury (SCI), as 
central pain manifests differently between these groups. This paper will focus 
on the history, clinical presentation, pathophysiology, assessment, and 
treatment of central pain in patients with these types of neurological 
conditions. In addition to being at risk for a decline in quality of life, 
patients with pain syndromes are also prone to adverse responses to treatments 
(e.g., opioid addiction). It is therefore important to methodically analyze the 
similarities and differences between patients with different pain syndromes.

The great plasticity of Schwann cells (SCs), the myelinating glia of the 
peripheral nervous system (PNS), is a critical feature in the context of 
peripheral nerve regeneration following traumatic injuries and peripheral 
neuropathies. After a nerve damage, SCs are rapidly activated by injury-induced 
signals and respond by entering the repair program. During the repair program, 
SCs undergo dynamic cell reprogramming and morphogenic changes aimed at 
promoting nerve regeneration and functional recovery. SCs convert into a repair 
phenotype, activate negative regulators of myelination and demyelinate the 
damaged nerve. Moreover, they express many genes typical of their immature state 
as well as numerous de-novo genes. These genes modulate and drive the 
regeneration process by promoting neuronal survival, damaged axon 
disintegration, myelin clearance, axonal regrowth and guidance to their former 
target, and by finally remyelinating the regenerated axon. Many signaling 
pathways, transcriptional regulators and epigenetic mechanisms regulate these 
events. In this review, we discuss the main steps of the repair program with a 
particular focus on the molecular mechanisms that regulate SC plasticity 
following peripheral nerve injury.

Introduction: Functional Dyspepsia (FD), defined as chronic symptoms originating 
from the gastroduodenal region in absence of readily identifiable organic 
disease, is one of the most common gastrointestinal disorders. FD is divided 
into two subgroups: Post-Prandial Distress Syndrome (PDS) or meal-related FD, 
characterized by postprandial fullness and early satiation, and Epigastric Pain 
Syndrome (EPS) or meal-unrelated FD, characterized by epigastric pain and 
burning.Areas covered: This review summarizes the existing and off-label 
therapeutic options for FD.Expert opinion: The identification of mechanisms, the 
Rome IV classification, the reduction of PDS/EPS overlap and pictograms for 
symptom identification allow a better diagnosis and a more targeted treatment 
choice. Acotiamide, a first-in-class prokinetic agent available only in Japan 
and India, is the only agent of proven efficacy for FD, but clinicians use 
acid-suppressive therapy, prokinetics, neuromodulators and herbal therapies for 
treating FD symptoms. New emerging targets are duodenal low-grade inflammation 
with eosinophils and duodenal or other modified luminal microbiota.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is widely 
used as a non-pharmacological approach for pain relief in a variety of clinical 
conditions. This manuscript aimed to review the basic mechanisms and clinical 
applications regarding the use of TENS for alleviating the peripheral (PNP) and 
central neuropathic pain (CNP).
RECENT FINDINGS: Basic studies on animal models showed that TENS could alleviate 
pain by modulating neurotransmitters and receptors in the stimulation site and 
its upper levels, including the spinal cord, brainstem, and brain. Besides, many 
clinical studies have investigated the efficacy of TENS in patients with CNP 
(caused by spinal cord injury, stroke, or multiple sclerosis) and PNP (induced 
by diabetes, cancer, or herpes zoster). Most clinical trials have demonstrated 
the efficacy of TENS in attenuating neuropathic pain and suggested that 
appropriate stimulation parameters (e.g., stimulation frequency and intensity) 
were critical to improving the analgesic effects of TENS. However, there are 
some conflicting findings related to the efficacy of TENS in relieving 
neuropathic pain. With optimized stimulation parameters, TENS would be effective 
in attenuating neuropathic pain. To obtain sufficient evidence to support the 
use of TENS in the clinic, researchers recommended performing multicenter 
clinical trials with optimized TENS protocols for the treatment of various CNP 
and PNP.

perineural injections, radiofrequency ablation, cryoablation, neuromodulation, 
and neurectomy. The efficacy of these therapies varies considerably. IL 
neuralgia is a common pain disorder characterized by pain in the lower abdomen 
and upper thigh. While various modalities can be used in the treatment of IL 
neuralgia, the efficacy of these modalities is at times limited. Dorsal root 
ganglion stimulation exhibits promise in the treatment of IL neuralgia. More 
research is needed to better address the needs of patients suffering from this 
disorder.

Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is the most utilized invasive electrical 
neuromodulation treatment for the management of refractory chronic pain 
syndromes. Infection is one of the most dreaded complications related to SCS 
implantation and may prevent patients from receiving adequate pain treatment, 
adding to the initial cost and disability. Most SCS infections present as 
generator pocket infection. However, delay in diagnosis may lead to 
complications such as meningitis, epidural abscess, and/or vertebral 
osteomyelitis. Early recognition of SCS-related infections and associated 
complications is based on clinical suspicion, laboratory testing, and 
appropriate diagnostic imaging. While superficial surgical site infection 
following SCS implant may be treated with antibiotic therapy alone, deep 
infection involving implant warrants device removal to achieve cure. Duration of 
antimicrobial therapy depends on severity of clinical presentation and presence 
or absence of associated complications. Several preventive strategies can be 
incorporated in surgical practice to reduce the risk of SCS infection.

INTRODUCTION: Since it became available in the mid-2010s, dorsal root ganglion 
(DRG) stimulation has become part of the armamentarium to treat chronic pain. To 
date, one randomized controlled trial, and several studies of moderate sample 
size and various etiologies have been published on this topic. We conducted a 
pooled analysis to investigate the generalizability of individual studies and to 
identify differences in outcome between chronic pain etiologic subgroups and/or 
pain location.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: One prospective, randomized comparative trial and six 
prospective, single-arm, observational studies were identified that met 
pre-defined acceptance criteria. Pain scores and patient-reported outcome (PRO) 
measures were weighted by study sample sizes and pooled. Safety data are 
reported in aggregate form.
RESULTS: Our analysis included 217 patients with a permanent implant at 12-month 
follow-up. Analysis of pooled data showed an overall weighted mean pain score of 
3.4, with 63% of patients reporting ≥50% pain relief. Effectiveness sub-analyses 
in CRPS-I, causalgia, and back pain resulted in a mean reduction in pain 
intensity of 4.9, 4.6, and 3.9 points, respectively. Our pooled analysis showed 
a pain score for primary affected region ranging from 1.7 (groin) to 3.0 
(buttocks) and responder rates of 80% for foot and groin, 75% for leg, and 70% 
for back. A substantial improvement in all PROs was observed at 12 months. The 
most commonly reported procedural or device complications were pain at the IPG 
pocket site, lead fracture, lead migration, and infection.
CONCLUSIONS: DRG stimulation is an effective and safe therapy for various 
etiologies of chronic pain.

ATP is a (co)transmitter and signaling molecule in the CNS. It acts at a 
multitude of ligand-gated cationic channels termed P2X to induce rapid 
depolarization of the cell membrane. Within this receptor-channel family, the 
P2X7 receptor (R) allows the transmembrane fluxes of Na+, Ca2+, and K+, but also 
allows the slow permeation of larger organic molecules. This is supposed to 
cause necrosis by excessive Ca2+ influx, as well as depletion of intracellular 
ions and metabolites. Cell death may also occur by apoptosis due to the 
activation of the caspase enzymatic cascade. Because P2X7Rs are localized in the 
CNS preferentially on microglia, but also at a lower density on neuroglia 
(astrocytes, oligodendrocytes) the stimulation of this receptor leads to the 
release of neurodegeneration-inducing bioactive molecules such as 
pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, proteases, reactive oxygen and nitrogen 
molecules, and the excitotoxic glutamate/ATP. Various neurodegenerative 
reactions of the brain/spinal cord following acute harmful events (mechanical 
CNS damage, ischemia, status epilepticus) or chronic neurodegenerative diseases 
(neuropathic pain, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) lead to a massive release of ATP via the leaky 
plasma membrane of neural tissue. This causes cellular damage superimposed on 
the original consequences of neurodegeneration. Hence, blood-brain-barrier 
permeable pharmacological antagonists of P2X7Rs with excellent bioavailability 
are possible therapeutic agents for these diseases. The aim of this review 
article is to summarize our present state of knowledge on the involvement of 
P2X7R-mediated events in neurodegenerative illnesses endangering especially the 
life quality and duration of the aged human population.

Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a common complication of diabetes 
mellitus that affects approximately half of patients with diabetes. Current 
treatment regimens cannot treat DPN effectively. Schwann cells (SCs) are very 
sensitive to glucose concentration and insulin, and closely associated with the 
occurrence and development of type 1 diabetic mellitus (T1DM) and DPN. Apoptosis 
of SCs is induced by hyperglycemia and is involved in the pathogenesis of DPN. 
This review considers the pathological processes of SCs apoptosis under high 
glucose, which include the following: oxidative stress, inflammatory reactions, 
endoplasmic reticulum stress, autophagy, nitrification and signaling pathways 
(PI3K/AKT, ERK, PERK/Nrf2, and Wnt/β-catenin). The clarification of mechanisms 
underlying SCs apoptosis induced by high glucose will help us to understand and 
identify more effective strategies for the treatment of T1DM DPN.

About 50 million of the U.S. adult population suffer from chronic pain. It is a 
complex disease in its own right for which currently available analgesics have 
been deemed woefully inadequate since ~20% of the sufferers derive no benefit. 
Vitamin D, known for its role in calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism, is 
thought to be of clinical benefit in treating chronic pain without the 
side-effects of currently available analgesics. A strong correlation between 
hypovitaminosis D and incidence of bone pain is known. However, the potential 
underlying mechanisms by which vitamin D might exert its analgesic effects are 
poorly understood. In this review, we discuss pathways involved in pain sensing 
and processing primarily at the level of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and 
the potential interplay between vitamin D, its receptor (VDR) and known specific 
pain signaling pathways including nerve growth factor (NGF), glial-derived 
neurotrophic factor (GDNF), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and opioid 
receptors. We also discuss how vitamin D/VDR might influence immune cells and 
pain sensitization as well as review the increasingly important topic of vitamin 
D toxicity. Further in vitro and in vivo experimental studies will be required 
to study these potential interactions specifically in pain models. Such studies 
could highlight the potential usefulness of vitamin D either alone or in 
combination with existing analgesics to better treat chronic pain.

The mature peripheral nervous system is a steady network structure yet shows 
remarkable regenerative properties. The interaction of peripheral nerves with 
myeloid cells has largely been investigated in the context of damage, following 
trauma or infection. Recently, specific macrophages dedicated to homeostatic 
peripheral nerves have come into focus. These macrophages are defined by tissue 
and nerve type, are seeded in part prenatally, and self-maintain via 
proliferation. Thus, they are markedly distinct from monocyte-derived 
macrophages invading after local disturbance of nerve integrity. The phenotypic 
and transcriptional adaptation of macrophages to the discrete nervous niche may 
exert axon guidance and nerve regeneration and thus contribute to the stability 
of the peripheral nervous network. Deciphering these conserved macrophage-nerve 
interactions offers new translational perspectives for chronic diseases of the 
peripheral nervous system, such as diabetic neuropathy and pain.

BACKGROUND: Painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN), a debilitating and progressive 
chronic pain condition that significantly impacts quality of life, is one of the 
common complications seen with long-standing diabetes mellitus. Neither 
pharmacological treatments nor low-frequency spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has 
provided significant and long-term pain relief for patients with PDN. This study 
aims to document the value of 10-kHz SCS in addition to conventional medical 
management (CMM) compared with CMM alone in patients with refractory PDN.
METHODS: In a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial (SENZA-PDN), 
216 subjects with PDN will be assigned 1:1 to receive 10-kHz SCS combined with 
CMM or CMM alone after appropriate institutional review board approvals and 
followed for 24 months. Key inclusion criteria include (1) symptoms of PDN for 
at least 12 months, (2) average pain intensity of at least 5 cm-on a 0- to 10-cm 
visual analog scale (VAS)-in the lower limbs, and (3) an appropriate candidate 
for SCS. Key exclusion criteria include (1) large or gangrenous ulcers or (2) 
average pain intensity of at least 3 cm on VAS in the upper limbs or both. Along 
with pain VAS, neurological assessments, health-related quality of life, sleep 
quality, and patient satisfaction will be captured. The primary endpoint 
comparing responder rates (≥50% pain relief) and safety rates between the 
treatment groups will be assessed at 3 months. Several secondary endpoints will 
also be reported on.
DISCUSSION: Enrollment commenced in 2017 and was completed in 2019. This study 
will help to determine whether 10-kHz SCS improves clinical outcomes and 
health-related quality of life and is a cost-effective treatment for PDN that is 
refractory to CMM.

OBJECTIVE: This prospective, open-label, multicenter study evaluated the 
feasibility of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) therapy programming for chronic low 
back pain that uses multiple electrical pulsed signals (Differential Target 
Multiplexed).
METHODS: Twenty-five SCS candidates with low back pain equal to or greater than 
lower limb pain were enrolled at 7 sites in the United States. The subjects 
evaluated standard and Differential Target Multiplexed programs, each for 
4 ± 1 days. A commercially available SCS trial system was used for standard SCS 
therapy programming. During the trialing of the multiplexed programs, implanted 
temporary leads were connected to an investigational external trial stimulator 
system.
RESULTS: Twenty subjects concluded the study. The mean baseline numeric pain 
rating scale (NPRS) score for low back pain was 7.4, with a mean age of 
62.4 years and mean pain duration of 18.0 years. Significant relief in back pain 
was observed for both treatments, with significantly better response with 
multiplexed programming. At the end of the trial period, subjects reported a 
reduction in their mean NPRS score from baseline to 4.2 after standard 
programming and to 2.4 after Differential Target Multiplexed programming. The 
difference between standard and multiplexed programming was significant. The 
responder rate for low back pain relief was 50% for standard programming and 80% 
for Differential Target Multiplexed programming. Eighty-five percent of subjects 
who evaluated both programming approaches preferred Differential Target 
Multiplexed SCS.
CONCLUSION: In this difficult-to-treat patient population, subjects reported 
significant reduction in chronic back pain when using multiplexed programming. A 
randomized clinical trial is needed to confirm the results from this feasibility 
study.

DBS is an effective neuromodulatory therapy that has been applied in various 
conditions, including PD, essential tremor, dystonia, Tourette syndrome, and 
other movement disorders. There have also been recent examples of applications 
in epilepsy, chronic pain, and neuropsychiatric conditions. Innovations in 
neuroimaging technology have been driving connectomics, an emerging whole-brain 
network approach to neuroscience. Two rising techniques are functional 
connectivity profiling and structural connectivity profiling. Functional 
connectivity profiling explores the operational relationships between multiple 
regions of the brain with respect to time and stimuli. Structural connectivity 
profiling approximates physical connections between different brain regions 
through reconstruction of axonal fibers. Through these techniques, complex 
relationships can be described in various disease states, such as PD, as well as 
in response to therapy, such as DBS. These advances have expanded our 
understanding of human brain function and have provided a partial in vivo 
glimpse into the underlying brain circuits underpinning movement and other 
disorders. This comprehensive review will highlight the contemporary concepts in 
brain connectivity as applied to DBS, as well as introduce emerging 
considerations in movement disorders. © 2020 International Parkinson and

INTRODUCTION: The exact mechanisms underlying the development and maintenance of 
phantom limb pain (PLP) are still unclear. This study aimed to identify the 
factors affecting pain intensity in patients with chronic, lower limb, traumatic 
PLP.
METHODS: This is a cross-sectional analysis of patients with PLP. We assessed 
amputation-related and pain-related clinical and demographic variables. We used 
univariate and multivariate models to evaluate the associated factors modulating 
PLP and residual limb pain (RLP) intensity.
RESULTS: We included 71 unilateral traumatic lower limb amputees. Results showed 
that (1) amputation-related perceptions were experienced by a large majority of 
the patients with chronic PLP (sensations: 90.1%, n = 64; residual pain: 81.7%, 
n = 58); (2) PLP intensity has 2 significant protective factors (phantom limb 
movement and having effective treatment for PLP previously) and 2 significant 
risk factors (phantom limb sensation intensity and age); and (3) on the other 
hand, for RLP, risk factors are different: presence of pain before amputation 
and level of amputation (in addition to the same protective factors).
CONCLUSION: These results suggest different neurobiological mechanisms to 
explain PLP and RLP intensity. While PLP risk factors seem to be related to 
maladaptive plasticity, since phantom sensation and older age are associated 
with more pain, RLP risk factors seem to have components leading to neuropathic 
pain, such as the amount of neural lesion and previous history of chronic pain. 
Interestingly, the phantom movement appears to be protective for both phenomena.

BACKGROUND: Recurrent and chronic low back pain, caused by degenerative lumbar 
spondylosis, commonly affects elderly patients, even those with no previous low 
back surgery. These patients, like those affected by failed back surgery 
syndrome (FBSS), may become unresponsive to medical conservative treatment and 
their quality of life could be easily compromised. Moreover, general 
comorbidities, obesity, and other typical conditions of the elderly may make 
surgery under general anesthesia riskier than the natural history of the 
disease. These patients could be considered affected by surgical back risk 
syndrome (SBRS).
METHODS: In this article, we report our preliminary observational prospective 
study on the role of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) in 3 groups of patients: the 
FBSS group, the SBRS group, and the "other" group. Selection criteria, treatment 
modality, and outcomes for each patient group are described and discussed. 
Moreover, a potentially useful diagnostic and therapeutic flowchart on the 
management options for lumbar back diseases is discussed.
RESULTS: The FBSS group included 25 patients, the SBRS group included 10 
patients, and the other group included 3 patients. In 22/25 patients with FBSS 
(88% of the total), the implantation of a definitive neurostimulator was 
successful. In almost all patients in both the SBRS and the other groups, the 
implantation of a definitive neurostimulator was successful.
CONCLUSIONS: In our opinion, SCS could be considered as a valid alternative 
treatment not only in selected patients affected by FBSS but also in selected 
patients affected by SBRS, in whom back surgery under general anesthesia may be 
challenging and overcome the potential benefit of the surgery itself. SBRS could 
be considered a new disease entity to be managed through SCS.

Tonic spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has been used as a treatment for chronic 
neuropathic pain ever since its discovery in late 1960s. Despite its clinical 
successes in a subset of chronic neuropathic pain syndromes, several limitations 
such as insufficient pain relief and uncomfortable paresthesias have led to the 
development of new targets, the dorsal root ganglion, and new stimulation 
waveforms, such as burst and high frequency. The aim of this review is to 
provide a brief overview of the main mechanisms behind the mode of action of the 
different SCS paradigms. Tonic SCS mainly acts via a segmental spinal mechanism 
where it induces GABA-release from inhibitory interneurons in the spinal dorsal 
horn. Tonic SCS concurrently initiates neuropathic pain modulation through a 
supraspinal-spinal feedback loop and serotonergic descending fibers. Mechanisms 
of stimulation of the DRG as well as those related to new SCS paradigms are now 
under investigation, where it seems that burst SCS not only stimulates sensory, 
discriminative aspects of pain (like Tonic SCS) but also emotional, affective, 
and motivational aspects of pain. Initial long-term study results on closed-loop 
SCS systems hold promise for improvement of future SCS treatment.

BACKGROUND: Dorsal root ganglion stimulation has established its role in chronic 
pain states and is commonly used as an alternative treatment to traditional 
spinal cord stimulation. Due to its approach, DRG stimulation is preferably used 
in pain conditions affecting a small area or a distinct nerve root. In selected 
patients, a combination of both techniques might be useful.
METHODS: We report a series of five patients with chronic pain treated with DRG 
stimulation and traditional spinal cord stimulation from 2011 to 2018. Pain was 
reported on the VAS scale at the baseline, before and 12 months after the second 
procedure.
RESULTS: All patients suffered from back and lower limb pain, four with a FBSS 
syndrome, one with CRPS. In all but one patient, SCS was implanted first and 
complemented with a DRG in the course (4-90 months between procedures). An 
additional stimulation system was implanted because the previous stimulation 
failed to reach the pain area or because the patient had an altered perception 
of other pain component after stimulation. All but one patient had a consistent 
and satisfying therapeutic effect with both systems activated.
CONCLUSION: The combination of dorsal root ganglion and traditional spinal cord 
stimulation is surgically and technically feasible. In selected patients, the 
combination of both methods offers an option to alleviate pain states not 
sufficiently or not efficiently treated with one method alone. The introduction 
of IPGs combining SCS and DRG stimulation paradigms might be useful to increase 
acceptance of this option.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cluster headache is a neurological disorder that patients 
consider the most severe pain they experience. Recognizing new treatments 
provides opportunities to advance current management.
RECENT FINDINGS: In contrast to the classic treatments, new options narrow in on 
the therapeutic target and are better tolerated. Calcitonin gene-related peptide 
(CGRP) pathway blockade with monoclonal antibodies (MABs), specifically the CGRP 
MAB galcanezumab, represents an important advance for episodic cluster headache, 
reducing the number of attacks during a bout. Neuromodulation strategies aimed 
at anatomical structures involved in the pathophysiology of cluster headache, 
such as the sphenopalatine ganglion and the vagus nerve, have proved effective 
in reducing the pain intensity and the number of attacks, and also to be safe 
and well tolerated.
SUMMARY: Our understanding of the pathophysiology of cluster headache and its 
management continues to grow. Novel treatments have appeared from research, such 
as neuromodulation and CGRP monoclonal antibodies. Nonetheless, chronic cluster 
headache and designing trials that select the correct sham in evaluating devices 
remain challenging.

Chronic pain is consistently listed as one of the most costly and disabling 
health problems worldwide. In an effort to treat these suffering individuals, 
significant amounts of time and energy have been devoted to discover safe and 
effective pain relieving treatments. Dorsal root ganglion stimulation is the 
newest treatment modality to be created for chronic intractable pain. In this 
manuscript, we review the history and development, published research and safety 
profile of the Proclaim™ DRG Neurostimulator System (Abbott, TX, USA). At last, 
we offer our outlook on future developments with dorsal root ganglion 
stimulation.

Invasive interventional procedures for managing pain in cancer patients are 
often underutilized following the popularization of the WHO analgesic ladder. 
The procedures that were successfully used until then were relegated away from 
mainstream palliative care practice, with the advent of newer opioids and 
adjuvants. Even though nerve blocks, intrathecal pumps and spinal cord 
stimulation were reintroduced as the fourth step of the WHO ladder, often 
referrals for these procedures are too late to produce a meaningful effect on 
quality of life. At this point most patients have advanced disease and are 
requiring end of life care. Additionally, it is becoming evident that at least 
10% of patients do not achieve good quality analgesia with oral opioids and are 
often troubled by unacceptable side effects. There is an increasing public 
awareness of the problems with long-term opioid therapy and some of these 
patients would certainly benefit from invasive procedures to alleviate their 
pain and improve their quality of life. Improving life quality and expectancy 
with better treatment options and increasing number of cancer survivors should 
be heralding a change and hence neurolytic procedures are to be used only in 
patients with limited life expectancy. ITDDs, neuromodulation and 
ever-increasing use of procedures routinely used in treating chronic 
nonmalignant pain would be the mainstay of interventional management until AI 
and nanotechnology would open doors for novel treatment options. Interventions 
should not be used as a last resort after multiple failed attempts at opioid 
therapy, but as an integral part of a management strategy including medical 
management, psychological and emotional welfare, and supportive care of the 
patient in a holistic manner. The curriculum of specialists should include 
appropriate training to safely perform and produce better quality evidence to 
validate the efficacy and safety of these challenging procedures.

Pain is a multidimensional experience mediated by distributed neural networks in 
the brain. To study this phenomenon, EEGs were collected from 20 subjects with 
chronic lumbar radiculopathy, 20 age and gender matched healthy subjects, and 17 
subjects with chronic lumbar pain scheduled to receive an implanted spinal cord 
stimulator. Analysis of power spectral density, coherence, and phase-amplitude 
coupling using conventional statistics showed that there were no significant 
differences between the radiculopathy and control groups after correcting for 
multiple comparisons. However, analysis of transient spectral events showed that 
there were differences between these two groups in terms of the number, power, 
and frequency-span of events in a low gamma band. Finally, we trained a binary 
support vector machine to classify radiculopathy versus healthy subjects, as 
well as a 3-way classifier for subjects in the 3 groups. Both classifiers 
performed significantly better than chance, indicating that EEG features contain 
relevant information pertaining to sensory states, and may be used to help 
distinguish between pain states when other clinical signs are inconclusive.

Chronic pain can have a devastating impact and lead to patient isolation. Many 
people with chronic pain are predisposed to anxiety-depressant symptoms, due to 
a lower quality life. The aim of the study is to demonstrate how neuromodulation 
methods, can encourage the reduction of chronic pain and an improvement in the 
quality of life, therefore advancing the restoration of psychological 
well-being.We involved 50 patients with a diagnosis of pain that not respond to 
traditional pharmacological therapies. Interventions: All subject had depression 
and anxiety symptoms and a low-quality life. We used the spinal cord stimulation 
treatment and a psychological evaluation for assessment of depression-anxiety 
symptomatology and the level of quality life.We observed a significant 
difference in physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health, 
general health perceptions, vitality, social functioning, role limitations due 
to emotional problems and mental health.Our study affirms that the perception of 
chronic pain has a great impact on the perception of psychological well-being, 
quality of life, and the performance of normal daily social and professional 
activities.

INTRODUCTION: Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is an effective treatment for 
chronic, intractable neuropathic pain. There have been relatively few high-level 
studies that suggest its unequivocal use. The decay of stimulation efficacy over 
time have opened opportunity for the entrance of new pulse trains and waveforms.
AREAS COVERED: In this state-of-the-art review, we focused on many of the major 
studies published in the last 10 years that were considered level one evidence. 
A retrospective narrative approach was taken to conceptualize foundation studies 
as they pertain to current evidence. A special focus was taken on reported 
safety outcomes in comparison to foundation studies especially as they pertain 
to our 5-year outlook on the use of spinal cord stimulation.
EXPERT OPINION: We find there are still significant limitations in the body of 
reviewed evidence and suggest that long-term data beyond 24 months are lacking 
in the literature. In addition, adverse event rates, device explantation rates 
and the sham effect looms as important concepts to address in the future in 
spite of the existing novel stimulation paradigms.

Constipation is both a symptom and a disorder, seen in both functional 
constipation and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation predominance 
(IBS-C). Despite the Rome IV criteria distinguishing between these conditions, 
they share many therapeutic approaches. This review aims to explore the 
relationship between constipation and abdominal pain and assess the evidence 
surrounding whether laxation improves abdominal pain and whether such a response 
to laxation differs between IBS-C and functional constipation. In patients with 
functional constipation, increasing frequency of bowel motions by laxatives 
regardless of mechanism of action is associated with reductions in the severity 
of abdominal pain, supporting the role of constipation as a contributor to 
abdominal discomfort. In patients with IBS-C, evidence from systematic reviews 
indicates that abdominal pain is driven by factors additional to constipation 
alone and that visceral analgesic modulation is also needed to optimize pain. 
Changing definitions of IBS-C and heterogeneity in clinical trial design 
including endpoints have raised uncertainty about the comparative ability of 
older laxatives without known neuromodulatory effects to improve chronic 
abdominal pain compared with new secretagogues and prokinetics for the 
management of IBS-C. While it is known that abdominal pain is associated with 
constipation and laxation contributes to relief of that pain, it remains 
unproven whether proposed visceral analgesic properties of new laxatives provide 
greater pain relief than laxation alone. However, it is likely that the response 
to laxation in IBS-C is only part of the puzzle.

BACKGROUND: Many potential environmental risk factors, environmental protective 
factors, and peripheral biomarkers for ADHD have been investigated, but the 
consistency and magnitude of their effects are unclear. We aimed to 
systematically appraise the published evidence of association between potential 
risk factors, protective factors, or peripheral biomarkers, and ADHD.
METHODS: In this umbrella review of meta-analyses, we searched PubMed including 
MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, from database 
inception to Oct 31, 2019, and screened the references of relevant articles. We 
included systematic reviews that provided meta-analyses of observational studies 
that examined associations of potential environmental risk factors, 
environmental protective factors, or peripheral biomarkers with diagnosis of 
ADHD. We included meta-analyses that used categorical ADHD diagnosis criteria 
according to DSM, hyperkinetic disorder according to ICD, or criteria that were 
less rigorous than DSM or ICD, such as self-report. We excluded articles that 
did not examine environmental risk factors, environmental protective factors, or 
peripheral biomarkers of ADHD; articles that did not include a meta-analysis; 
and articles that did not present enough data for re-analysis. We excluded 
non-human studies, primary studies, genetic studies, and conference abstracts. 
We calculated summary effect estimates (odds ratio [OR], relative risk [RR], 
weighted mean difference [WMD], Cohen's d, and Hedges' g), 95% CI, heterogeneity 
I2 statistic, 95% prediction interval, small study effects, and excess 
significance biases. We did analyses under credibility ceilings, and assessed 
the quality of the meta-analyses with AMSTAR 2 (A Measurement Tool to Assess 
Systematic Reviews 2). This study is registered with PROSPERO, number 
CRD42019145032.
FINDINGS: We identified 1839 articles, of which 35 were eligible for inclusion. 
These 35 articles yielded 63 meta-analyses encompassing 40 environmental risk 
factors and environmental protective factors (median cases 16 850, median 
population 91 954) and 23 peripheral biomarkers (median cases 175, median 
controls 187). Evidence of association was convincing (class I) for maternal 
pre-pregnancy obesity (OR 1·63, 95% CI 1·49 to 1·77), childhood eczema (1·31, 
1·20 to 1·44), hypertensive disorders during pregnancy (1·29, 1·22 to 1·36), 
pre-eclampsia (1·28, 1·21 to 1·35), and maternal acetaminophen exposure during 
pregnancy (RR 1·25, 95% CI 1·17 to 1·34). Evidence of association was highly 
suggestive (class II) for maternal smoking during pregnancy (OR 1·6, 95% CI 1·45 
to 1·76), childhood asthma (1·51, 1·4 to 1·63), maternal pre-pregnancy 
overweight (1·28, 1·21 to 1·35), and serum vitamin D (WMD -6·93, 95% CI -9·34 to 
-4·51).
INTERPRETATION: Maternal pre-pregnancy obesity and overweight; pre-eclampsia, 
hypertension, acetaminophen exposure, and smoking during pregnancy; and 
childhood atopic diseases were strongly associated with ADHD. Previous familial 
studies suggest that maternal pre-pregnancy obesity, overweight, and smoking 
during pregnancy are confounded by familial or genetic factors, and further 
high-quality studies are therefore required to establish causality.

INTRODUCTION: ACCURATE, a randomized controlled trial comparing dorsal root 
ganglion (DRG) stimulation to spinal cord stimulation, showed that DRG 
stimulation is a safe and effective therapy in individuals with lower extremity 
chronic pain due to complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) type I or II. 
Investigators noted that DRG stimulation programming could be adjusted to 
minimize, or eliminate, the feeling of paresthesia while maintaining adequate 
pain relief. The present study explores treatment outcomes for DRG subjects who 
were paresthesia-free vs. those who experienced the sensation of paresthesia, as 
well as the factors that predicted paresthesia-free analgesia.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of therapy outcomes was conducted for 61 
subjects in the ACCURATE study who received a permanent DRG neurostimulator. 
Outcomes of subjects who were paresthesia-free were compared to those who 
experienced paresthesia-present therapy at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12-month follow-ups. 
Predictor variables for the presence or absence of paresthesias with DRG 
stimulation were also explored.
RESULTS: The percentage of subjects with paresthesia-free pain relief increased 
from 16.4% at 1-month to 38.3% at 12-months. Paresthesia-free subjects generally 
had similar or better outcomes for pain severity, pain interference, quality of 
life, and mood state as subjects with paresthesia-present stimulation. Factors 
that increased the odds of a subject feeling paresthesia were higher stimulation 
amplitudes and frequencies, number of implanted leads, and younger age.
CONCLUSIONS: Some DRG subjects achieved effective paresthesia-free analgesia in 
the ACCURATE trial. This supports the observation that paresthesia is not 
synonymous with pain relief or required for optimal analgesia with DRG 
stimulation.

OBJECTIVES: The gait disturbance in spastic paraplegic patients lowers the gait 
speed, increases fall risk and eventually lower the quality of life. This study 
aims to investigate the effect of electrical twitch obtaining intramuscular 
stimulation (ETOIMS) on spastic paraplegic patients' gait speed and pattern.
METHODS: A prospective short-term cohort study was designed in the outpatient 
clinic of the department of rehabilitation in a tertiary hospital. Patients with 
spastic paraplegia (N=5) were participated, including spinal cord tumour (N=2), 
cervical myelitis (N=1), hereditary spastic paraplegia (NIPA1 mutation; N=1) and 
spinal cord injury (N=1). The participants underwent ETOIMS. The target muscles 
were the bilateral quadratus lumborum, multifidus inserting to the L4 and L5 
spinous process, and gluteus medius. Gait speed, gait pattern and subjective 
symptoms, including pain scores (measured by visual analogue scale), were 
compared before and immediately after the intervention.
RESULTS: All patients subjectively reported reduced stiffness during walking and 
alleviated muscular pain in the lower back and gluteal area. After one session 
of ETOIMS, patient 1-4 showed 57%, 29%, 33% and 6 % improvement in gait speed, 
respectively, and all patients showed increased pelvic dissociation.
CONCLUSIONS: The ETOIMS can be effective in improving gait speed and stability 
by relaxing the muscles or alleviating the pain in the lower back and gluteal 
area in spastic paraplegic patients.

OBJECTIVE: Spinal cord injury (SCI) disrupts the communication between brain and 
body parts innervated from below-injury spinal segments, but rarely results in 
complete anatomical transection of the spinal cord. The aim of this study was to 
investigate residual somatosensory conduction in clinically complete SCI, to 
corroborate the concept of sensory discomplete SCI.
METHODS: We used fMRI with a somatosensory protocol in which blinded and 
randomized tactile and nociceptive stimulation was applied on both legs 
(below-injury level) and one arm (above-injury level) in eleven participants 
with chronic complete SCI. The experimental design accounts for possible 
confounding mechanical (e.g. vibration) and cortico-cortical top-down mechanisms 
(e.g. attention/expectation).
RESULTS: Somatosensory stimulation on below-level insensate body regions 
activated the somatotopically corresponding part of the contralateral primary 
somatosensory cortex in six out of eleven participants.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results represent afferent-driven cortical activation through 
preserved somatosensory connections to the brain in a subgroup of participants 
with clinically complete SCI, i.e. sensory discomplete SCI.
SIGNIFICANCE: Identifying patients with residual somatosensory connections might 
open the door for new rehabilitative and restorative strategies as well as 
inform research on SCI-related conditions such as neuropathic pain and 
spasticity.

Peripheral nerves contain axons and their enwrapping glia cells named Schwann 
cells (SCs) that are either myelinating (mySCs) or nonmyelinating (nmSCs). Our 
understanding of other cells in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) remains 
limited. Here, we provide an unbiased single cell transcriptomic 
characterization of the nondiseased rodent PNS. We identified and independently 
confirmed markers of previously underappreciated nmSCs and nerve-associated 
fibroblasts. We also found and characterized two distinct populations of 
nerve-resident homeostatic myeloid cells that transcriptionally differed from 
central nervous system microglia. In a model of chronic autoimmune neuritis, 
homeostatic myeloid cells were outnumbered by infiltrating lymphocytes which 
modulated the local cell-cell interactome and induced a specific transcriptional 
response in glia cells. This response was partially shared between the 
peripheral and central nervous system glia, indicating common immunological 
features across different parts of the nervous system. Our study thus identifies 
subtypes and cell-type markers of PNS cells and a partially conserved 
autoimmunity module induced in glia cells.

BACKGROUND: Following amputation, nearly all amputees report nonpainful phantom 
phenomena and many of them suffer from chronic phantom limb pain (PLP) and 
residual limb pain (RLP). The aetiology of PLP remains elusive and there is an 
ongoing debate on the role of peripheral and central mechanisms. Few studies 
have examined the entire somatosensory pathway from the truncated nerves to the 
cortex in amputees with PLP compared to those without PLP. The relationship 
among afferent input, somatosensory responses and the change in PLP remains 
unclear.
METHODS: Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation was applied on the 
truncated median nerve, the skin of the residual limb and the contralateral 
homologous nerve in 22 traumatic upper-limb amputees (12 with and 10 without 
PLP). Using somatosensory event-related potentials, the ascending volley was 
monitored from the brachial plexus, the spinal cord, the brainstem and the 
thalamus to the primary somatosensory cortex.
RESULTS: Peripheral input could evoke PLP in amputees with chronic PLP (7/12), 
but not in amputees without a history of PLP (0/10). The amplitudes of the 
somatosensory components were comparable between amputees with and without PLP. 
In addition, evoked potentials from the periphery through the spinal, 
subcortical and cortical segments were not significantly associated with PLP.
CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral input can modulate PLP but seems insufficient to cause 
PLP. These findings suggest the multifactorial complexity of PLP and different 
mechanisms for PLP and RLP.
SIGNIFICANCE: Peripheral afferent input plays a role in PLP and has been assumed 
to be sufficient to generate PLP. In this study we found no significant 
differences in the electrical potentials generated by peripheral stimulation 
from the truncated nerve and the skin of the residual limb in amputees with and 
without PLP. Peripheral input could enhance existing PLP but could not cause it. 
These findings indicate the multifactorial complexity of PLP and an important 
role of central processes in PLP.

OBJECTIVE: Spinal cord injury remains a highly morbid entity, with limited 
treatment modalities in both acute and chronic settings. Clinical research 
efforts to improve therapeutic guidelines are confounded by initial evaluation 
inaccuracies, as presentations are frequently complicated by trauma and 
objective diagnostic and prognostic methods are poorly defined. The purpose 
of our study was to review recent practical advances for further delineation of 
these injuries and how such classification may benefit the development of novel 
treatments.
METHODS: A review was carried out of recent studies reported within the last 5 
years for prognostic and diagnostic modalities of acute spinal cord injury.
RESULTS: Substantial efforts have been made to improve the timeliness and 
accuracy of the initial assessment, not only for the purpose of enhancing 
prognostication but also in determining the efficacy of new treatments. Whether 
it be applying traumatic brain injury principles to limit injury extent, 
external stimulators used for chronic pain conditions to enhance the effects of 
physical therapy, or creative algorithms incorporating various nerve or muscle 
transfer techniques, innovative and practical solutions continue to be developed 
in lieu of definitive treatment. Further development will benefit from enhanced 
stratification of injury from accurate and practical assessment modalities.
CONCLUSIONS: Recent advances in accurate, timely, and practical classification 
methods of acute spinal cord injury will assist in the development of novel 
treatment approaches for both acute and chronic injury alike.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review focuses on the relationship between trauma and 
pain in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and offers effective treatment 
strategies.
RECENT FINDINGS: Recent evidence points to bidirectional pathways between 
psychiatric disorders and IBD. The impact of trauma and development of 
post-traumatic stress symptoms on IBD disease course is beginning to be 
appreciated including its relationship with pain. First-line treatments for both 
psychiatric and chronic pain disorders include behavioral interventions such as 
cognitive behavioral therapy, hypnosis, and mindfulness, and there is emerging 
evidence studying Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and telehealth 
interventions. Pharmacological treatments using neuromodulators can also be 
beneficial. An integrated care team, such as a subspecialty medical home model, 
can provide the best patient experience and address comprehensive care needs 
efficiently and effectively. Psychosocial factors impact IBD course and 
necessitate effective management. Despite the significant limitations of 
research, particularly lack of clinical trials examining behavioral and 
pharmacotherapy interventions in IBD, effective treatments exist and are best 
utilized in an integrated care setting.

BACKGROUND: Chronic pain syndromes are clinically challenging to treat, and 
management with opioid medications is increasingly shown to be inappropriate and 
ineffective. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has been demonstrated across numerous 
high-quality and well-designed studies to be effective in treating various 
refractory chronic pain. The efficacy and overall success of SCS is highly 
dependent on compliance to and consideration of various practice patterns.
OBJECTIVE: This manuscript is intended to compile and present comprehensive 
recommendations for key SCS management principles including: a) patient 
selection criteria, b) efficacy of SCS for various conditions, c) discussion of 
SCS waveforms, d) trial and permanent implantation considerations, e) 
periprocedural management, and f) complications and adverse events.
STUDY DESIGN: An evidence-based narrative review.
METHODS: PubMed, Medline, Cochrane Library, prior systematic reviews, and 
reference lists were screened by 2 separate authors for all randomized trials, 
meta-analyses, and observational studies relevant to each of the aforementioned 
management principles and considered for study inclusion.
RESULTS: All high-level evidence studies that explored the various facets of SCS 
practice management were included for review.
LIMITATIONS: Both continued investigation into, and practice implementation of, 
the various facets of SCS management are necessary to optimize patient outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Implementation of and adherence to the evidenced-based 
recommendations delineated in this publication may help optimize efficacy 
outcomes and maintain safety profiles for persons treated with SCS 
interventions.

OBJECTIVE: To identify variables that influence pain reduction following 
peripheral nerve field stimulation (PNFS) in order to identify a potential 
responder profile.
METHODS: Exploratory univariate and multivariate (random forest) analyses were 
performed separately on 2 randomized controlled trials and a registry; all 
included patients with chronic back pain, mainly failed back surgery syndrome. 
An international expert panel judged the clinical relevance of variables to 
identify responders by consensus.
RESULTS: Variables identified that may help predict PNFS success in patients 
with back pain include patient and pain characteristics (age, time since onset 
of pain and spinal surgery, pain medication history, position and size of pain 
area, pain severity, mixed nociceptive/neuropathic pain, health-related quality 
of life, depression, functional disability, and leg pain status), implant 
procedure variables (the number and position of leads, paresthesia coverage, and 
amount of pain relief during the trial), and programming (number of programs, 
cathodes, and anodes; pulse rate; pulse width; and percentage of device usage).
CONCLUSIONS: While these analyses are exploratory and restricted to a limited 
sample size, they suggest variables that may play a role in predicting a 
therapeutic response. These results, however, are informative only and should be 
cautiously interpreted. Future research to validate the variables in a clinical 
study is needed.

Introduction to Purinergic Signaling.

Burnstock G(1).

Author information:

Parkville, VIC, Australia. gburnstock@unimelb.edu.au.

Purinergic signaling was proposed in 1972, after it was demonstrated that 
adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) was a transmitter in nonadrenergic, 
noncholinergic inhibitory nerves supplying the guinea-pig taenia coli. Later, 
ATP was identified as an excitatory cotransmitter in sympathetic and 
parasympathetic nerves, and it is now apparent that ATP acts as a cotransmitter 
in most, if not all, nerves in both the peripheral nervous system and central 
nervous system (CNS). ATP acts as a short-term signaling molecule in 
neurotransmission, neuromodulation, and neurosecretion. It also has potent, 
long-term (trophic) roles in cell proliferation, differentiation, and death in 
development and regeneration. Receptors to purines and pyrimidines have been 
cloned and characterized: P1 adenosine receptors (with four subtypes), P2X 
ionotropic nucleotide receptors (seven subtypes) and P2Y metabotropic nucleotide 
receptors (eight subtypes). ATP is released from different cell types by 
mechanical deformation, and after release, it is rapidly broken down by 
ectonucleotidases. Purinergic receptors were expressed early in evolution and 
are widely distributed on many different nonneuronal cell types as well as 
neurons. Purinergic signaling is involved in embryonic development and in the 
activities of stem cells. There is a growing understanding about the 
pathophysiology of purinergic signaling and there are therapeutic developments 
for a variety of diseases, including stroke and thrombosis, osteoporosis, pain, 
chronic cough, kidney failure, bladder incontinence, cystic fibrosis, dry eye, 
cancer, and disorders of the CNS, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's. and 
Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, migraine, and 
neuropsychiatric and mood disorders.

BACKGROUND: Chronic pain has been associated with alterations in brain structure 
and function that appear dependent on pain phenotype. Functional connectivity 
(FC) data on chronic back pain (CBP) is limited and based on heterogeneous pain 
populations. We hypothesize that failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) patients 
being considered for spinal cord stimulation (SCS) therapy have altered resting 
state (RS) FC cross-network patterns that 1) specifically involve emotion and 
reward/aversion functions and 2) are related to pain scores.
METHODS: RS functional MRI (fMRI) scans were obtained for 10 FBSS patients who 
are being considered for but who have not yet undergone implantation of a 
permanent SCS device and 12 healthy age-matched controls. Seven RS networks were 
analyzed including the striatum (STM). The Wilcoxon signed-rank test evaluated 
differences in cross-network FC strength (FCS). Differences in periaqueductal 
grey (PAG) FC were assessed with seed-based analysis.
RESULTS: Cross-network FCS was decreased (p<0.05) between the STM and all other 
networks in these FBSS patients. There was a negative linear relationship (R2 = 
0.76, p<0.0022) between STMFCS index and pain scores. The PAG showed decreased 
FC with network elements and amygdala but increased FC with the sensorimotor 
cortex and cingulate gyrus.
CONCLUSIONS: Decreased FC between STM and other RS networks in FBSS has not been 
previously reported. This STMFCS index may represent a more objective measure of 
chronic pain specific to FBSS which may help guide patient selection for SCS and 
subsequent management.

In inflammatory peripheral demyelinating disorders, demyelination represents 
segmental demyelination in which the myelin sheath of a myelinating Schwann cell 
(SC) is completely removed by macrophages or a partial myelin degeneration in 
the paranode occurring due to autoantibodies attacking the node/paranode. For 
the segmental demyelination from living myelin-forming SCs, macrophages 
infiltrate within the endoneurium and insinuate between myelin lamellae and the 
cytoplasm of SCs, and the myelin is then removed via phagocytosis. During the 
macrophage invasion into the SC cytoplasm from the node of Ranvier and 
internodal areas, the attacked SCs do not remain quiescent but 
transdifferentiate into inflammatory demyelinating SCs (iDSCs), which exhibit 
unique demyelination pathologies, such as myelin uncompaction from 
Schmidt-Lanterman incisures with myelin lamellae degeneration. The longitudinal 
extension of this self-myelin clearance process of iDSCs into the nodal region 
is associated with the degeneration of nodal microvilli and paranodal loops, 
which provides a potential locus for macrophage infiltration. In addition to the 
nodal intrusion, macrophages appear to be able to invade fenestrated internodal 
plasma membrane or the degenerated outer mesaxon of iDSC. These SC demyelination 
morphologies indicate that the SC reprogramming to iDSCs may be a prerequisite 
for macrophage-mediated inflammatory demyelination. In contrast, paranodal 
demyelination caused by autoantibodies to nodal/paranodal antigens does not 
result in iDSC-dependent macrophage infiltration and subsequent segmental 
demyelination. In the context of inflammatory demyelination, the novel 
perspective of iDSCs provides an important viewpoint to understand the 
pathophysiology of demyelinating peripheral neuropathies and establish 
diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

Pain has a major impact on anxiety and depression levels. The aim of this study 
is to demonstrate how these symptoms (depression and anxiety) could positively 
influence the perception of pain after neurostimulation system implantation.We 
enrolled 100 patients and divided in 2 different groups, by using tests 
screening such as Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale 
(HAM-A), Nursing Rating Scale (NRS): the group with spinal cord stimulation 
(SCS) and the group with pulsed spinal cord radiofrequency (RFP).We highlighted 
a significant decrease of scores (BDI, HAM-A, NRS) in each group between T0 
(baseline) and T1. Moreover, the intra-group analysis showed a positive 
significant correlation between NRS and depressive and anxiety symptoms.We 
assert that the use of alternative methods (SCS and RFP) to the traditional 
pharmaceutical-surgical treatments, provide the reduction of the algic and 
anxiety-depressant symptoms, restoring also the perception of psychological 
well-being.

BACKGROUND: The clinical outcomes of Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) therapy in 
patients with a Failed Back Surgery Syndrome (FBSS) is mostly done by 
standardized pain and quality of life measurements instruments and hardly 
account for personal feelings and needs as a basis for a patient-centred 
approach and shared decision making.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to explore perspectives on personal 
health and quality of life (QoL) in FBSS patients concerning their physical-, 
psychological and spiritual well-being prior to receiving an SCS system.
METHODS: We performed face-to-face, semi-structured, in-depth interviews to 
obtain descriptive and detailed data on personal health, guided by the Web 
diagram of Positive Health (Huber et al.) and a topic list. The following main 
topics were assessed qualitatively: 1) Bodily functioning, 2) Mental function 
and perception 3) Spiritual dimension, 4) Quality of life, 5) Social and 
societal participation and 6) Daily functioning.
RESULTS: Seventeen FBSS patients (eight male, nine female) were included from 
April-November 2019 at the department of pain medicine in the Albert Schweitzer 
Hospital in the Netherlands. Median age 49 years; range 28 to 67 years, and 
patients underwent between one and five lumbar surgical operations. The duration 
of their chronic pain was between four and 22 years. After analyzing the 
interviews, three themes emerged: 1) dealing with chronic pain, 2) the current 
situation regarding aspects of positive health, and 3) future perspectives on 
health and quality of life. These themes arose from eleven categories and a 
hundred ninety codes.
CONCLUSION: This qualitative study explored FBSS patients 'views on their health 
and the ability to adapt to daily life having complex chronic pain, and showed 
that patients experienced shortcomings in daily life within the six dimensions 
of the Web diagram of Positive Health before the SCS implant.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Neurofeedback (NFB) provides real-time feedback about 
neurophysiological signals to patients, thereby encouraging modulation of 
pain-associated brain activity. This review aims to evaluate the effectiveness 
and safety of NFB in alleviating pain and pain-associated symptoms in chronic 
pain patients.
METHODS: MEDLINE, PUBMED, Web of Science and PsycINFO databases were searched 
using the strategy: ("Neurofeedback" OR "EEG Biofeedback" OR "fMRI Biofeedback") 
AND ("Pain" or "Chronic Pain"). Clinical trials reporting changes in pain 
following electroencephalogram (EEG) or functional magnetic resonance imaging 
(fMRI) NFB in chronic pain patients were included. Only Randomized-controlled 
trials (RCT), non-randomized controlled trials (NRCT) and case series were 
included. Effect size was pooled for all RCTs in a meta-analysis.
RESULTS: Twenty-one studies were included. Reduction in pain following NFB was 
reported by one high-quality RCT, five of six low-quality RCT or NRCT and 13 of 
14 case-series. Pain reduction reported by studies ranged from 6% to 82%, with 
10 studies reporting a clinically significant reduction in pain of >30%. The 
overall effect size was medium (cohen's d -0.76, 95% confidence interval -1.31 
to -0.20). Studies were highly heterogeneous (Q [df = 5] = 18.46, p = .002, I2 
 = 73%). Improvements in depression, anxiety, fatigue and sleep were also seen 
in some studies. Common side-effects included headache, nausea and drowsiness. 
These generally did not lead to withdrawal of therapy except in one study.
CONCLUSIONS: Neurofeedback is a safe and effective therapy with promising but 
largely low-quality evidence supporting its use in chronic pain. Further 
high-quality trials comparing different protocols is warranted to determine the 
most efficacious way to deliver NFB.
SIGNIFICANCE: Neurofeedback is a novel neuromodulatory approach which can be 
used to reduce the severity of pain and pain-associated symptoms such as sleep 
disturbances, mood disturbances, fatigue and anxiety in a number of chronic pain 
conditions. It has a potential to provide integrative non-pharmacological 
management for chronic pain patients with pain refractory to pharmacological 
agents with high side-effect profiles. Further high-quality double-blinded 
randomized sham-controlled trials are needed in order to fully explore the 
potential of this therapy.

BACKGROUND: Clinical trials have shown the safety and clinical superiority of 
erenumab compared to placebo in chronic migraine (CM). The aim of this analysis 
is to evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of erenumab in a real-world 
setting in patients with refractory CM.
METHODS: This is a prospective single centre real-world audit conducted in 
patients with CM with and without medication overuse, refractory to established 
preventive medications, who received monthly erenumab for 6 months.
RESULTS: Of 164 patients treated, 162 patients (female = 135, mean age 
46 ± 14.3 years old) were included in the audit. Patients had failed a mean of 
8.4 preventive treatments at baseline and 91% of patients failed Botulinum toxin 
type A at baseline. The mean reduction in monthly migraine days was 6.0 days at 
month 3 (P = 0.002) and 7.5 days at month 6 (P < 0.001) compared to baseline. 
The mean reduction in monthly headache days was 6.3 days (P < 0.001) at month 3 
and 6.8 days (P < 0.001) at month 6. At month 3, 49%, 35% and 13% and at month 
6, 60%, 38% and 22% of patients obtained at least a 30%, 50% and 75% reduction 
in migraine days, respectively. The percentage of patients with medication 
overuse was reduced from 54% at baseline to 20% at month 3 and to 25% at month 
6. Compared to baseline, the mean reduction of Headache Impact Test-6 score was 
7.7 points at month 3 (from 67.6 ± 0.4 to 59.9 ± 0.9) (P < 0.001) and of 7.5 
points at month 6 (60.1 ± 1.3) (P = 0.01). The percentage of patients with 
severe headache-related disability (HIT-6: 60-78) was reduced from 96% at 
baseline to 68% after three monthly treatments and to 59% after six treatments. 
At least one side effect was reported by 48% of patients at month 1, 22% at 
month 3 and 15% at month 6. Constipation (20%) and cold/flu-like symptoms (15%) 
were the most frequent adverse events reported.
CONCLUSION: Erenumab may be an effective and well tolerated therapy for 
medically refractory CM patients with and without medication overuse.

Systemic immune dysregulation contributes to the development of neuropsychiatric 
and neurodegenerative diseases. The precise effect of chronic peripheral immune 
stimulation on myeloid cells across anatomical brain regions is unclear. Here, 
we demonstrate brain-region-specific differences in myeloid responses induced by 
chronic peripheral inflammation. This shift in the myeloid compartment is 
associated with the appearance of an inflammatory myeloid subpopulation in the 
cortex, striatum, and thalamus accompanied by regional transcriptomic 
fingerprints that include induction of chemokines, complement factors, and 
endothelial adhesion molecules. In contrast, myeloid immune responses within the 
hippocampus and cerebellum are subtle or absent. Treatment with the anti-tumor 
necrosis factor α (anti-TNF-α) antibody infliximab ablates the region-specific 
inflammatory response. A region-specific myeloid cell response to chronic 
peripheral inflammation is observed in postmortem brains from individuals with 
rheumatoid arthritis. Our data suggest that chronic peripheral inflammation has 
heterogeneous effects on the brain, as evidenced by the spectrum of myeloid cell 
responses observed across brain regions.

To investigate sensory changes, physical function (pF), quality of life (QoL) 
and pain intensity of patients with osteoarthritis (OA) in the natural course of 
disease, and patients undergoing total joint replacement therapy (TJR) 31 (20 
females, mean age 64.6 ± 10.4 years), patients with OA were investigated with 
questionnaires and quantitative sensory testing (QST) in the area of referred 
pain at the thigh at baseline and follow-up 22-49 weeks later; changes were 
analyzed separately for patients with (n = 13) and without TJR (n = 18). In 
patients without TJR pain intensity, pF, QoL did not improve, and increased pain 
sensitivity to cold and a stronger loss of detection were observed. In patients 
after TJR, however, a reduction in mechanical pain sensitivity and allodynia 
occurred in accordance with a reduction of pain intensity and improvement of 
functionality while QoL did not improve. Additionally, an increased sensitivity 
to heat pain and a more pronounced loss of mechanical detection could be 
observed in this group. TJR seems to stop peripheral pain input leading to a 
reduction of pain intensity and central sensitization, but surgery-induced 
sensory changes such as peripheral sensitization and loss of detection occur. 
Furthermore, TJR has favorable effects on pain intensity and functionality but 
not QoL.

Diabetes triggers peripheral nerve alterations at a structural and functional 
level, collectively referred to as diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). This 
work highlights the role of the liver X receptor (LXR) signaling pathway and the 
cross talk with the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-producing enzyme NADPH 
oxidase-4 (Nox4) in the pathogenesis of DPN. Using type 1 diabetic (T1DM) mouse 
models together with cultured Schwann cells (SCs) and skin biopsies from 
patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), we revealed the implication of LXR and 
Nox4 in the pathophysiology of DPN. T1DM animals exhibit neurophysiological 
defects and sensorimotor abnormalities paralleled by defective peripheral myelin 
gene expression. These alterations were concomitant with a significant reduction 
in LXR expression and increase in Nox4 expression and activity in SCs and 
peripheral nerves, which were further verified in skin biopsies of patients with 
T2DM. Moreover, targeted activation of LXR or specific inhibition of Nox4 in 
vivo and in vitro to attenuate diabetes-induced ROS production in SCs and 
peripheral nerves reverses functional alteration of the peripheral nerves and 
restores the homeostatic profiles of MPZ and PMP22. Taken together, our findings 
are the first to identify novel, key mediators in the pathogenesis of DPN and 
suggest that targeting LXR/Nox4 axis is a promising therapeutic approach.

BACKGROUND: The treatment of chronic refractory low back pain (LBP) is 
challenging. Conservative and pharmacologic options have demonstrated limited 
efficacy. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has been shown to be effective in 
reducing chronic LBP in various contexts. With emerging SCS technologies, the 
collective evidence of novel waveforms relative to traditional tonic stimulation 
for treating chronic LBP has yet to be clearly characterized.
OBJECTIVES: To provide evidence for various SCS waveforms-tonic, burst, and high 
frequency (HF)-relative to each other for treating chronic LBP.
STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis.
METHODS: PubMed, Medline, Cochrane Library, prior systematic reviews, and 
reference lists were screened by 2 separate authors for all randomized trials 
and prospective cohort studies comparing different SCS waveforms for treatment 
of chronic LBP.
RESULTS: We identified 11 studies that included waveform comparisons for 
treating chronic LBP. Of these, 6 studies compared burst versus tonic, 2 studies 
compared burst versus HF, and 3 studies compared tonic versus HF. A 
meta-analysis of 5 studies comparing burst versus tonic was conducted and 
revealed pooled superiority of burst over tonic in pain reduction. One study 
comparing burst versus tonic was excluded given technical challenges in data 
extraction.
LIMITATIONS: Both randomized controlled trials and prospective cohort studies 
were included for meta-analysis. Several studies included a high risk of bias in 
at least one domain.
CONCLUSIONS: Burst stimulation is superior to tonic stimulation for treating 
chronic LBP. However, superiority among other waveforms has yet to be clearly 
established given some heterogeneity and limitations in evidence. Given the 
relative novelty of burst and HF SCS waveforms, evidence of longitudinal 
efficacy is needed.

In the last three decades, a number of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) 
protocols, capable of assessing and modulating plasticity in the human motor 
cortex (M1), have been described. For almost as long, NIBS has delivered the 
tantalising prospect of non-invasive neuromodulation as a therapeutic 
intervention for neurorehabilitation, psychiatry, chronic pain and other disease 
states. Apart from modest effects in depression, this early promise has not been 
realised since the symptomatic improvements produced by NIBS are generally weak. 
One key factor explaining this lack of clinical translation concerns variability 
in response to NIBS. Several studies have demonstrated a number of 
physiological, technical and statistical factors accounting for intra- and 
inter-subject variability. However, solutions to overcome this problem are still 
under debate. In the present review, we have provided a detailed description of 
methodological and technical solutions to control known factors influencing 
variability. We have also suggested potential strategies to strengthen and 
stabilize NIBS-induced after-effects. Finally, we propose new possible outcome 
variables which better reflect intrinsic cortical activity, allowing a more 
sensitive measurement and valid interpretation of responses to NIBS.

Psychotropic medications have modulatory effects on spinal cord stimulator (SCS) 
therapy and may play an important role in determining treatment success in 
chronic pain management. However, it remains unknown how SCS affects 
psychotropic use and whether the medications affect outcome. We performed a 
retrospective study to determine the prevalence of psychotropic medication (i.e. 
anxiolytic, antidepressant, and anticonvulsant) use among new SCS patients 
immediately before implantation and characterized the dosage changes at 1-year. 
We also sought to understand whether pre-operative medication status affects 
outcome, defined as device explantation due to treatment failure. In an analysis 
of 45 patients, 31%, 51% and 71% were actively taking anxiolytics, 
antidepressants, and anticonvulsants, respectively, before surgery. In the 
majority of cases, daily dosages remained the same for all three classes of 
medication at 1-year. Patients who were on two or more classes of medications 
pre-operatively had significantly lower explantation rate compared to those with 
one or none (12% vs. 43%, p = 0.041) and had 5.25 times less likelihood of 
explanation in the future (OR 5.25, 95%CI 1.18-23.2, p = 0.029). Our study 
suggest that peri-operative multimodality medical treatment may enhance the 
therapeutic efficacy and durability of SCS in carefully selected chronic pain 
patients.

The brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a crucial neuromodulator in pain 
transmission both in peripheral and central nervous system (CNS). Despite 
evidence of a pro-nociceptive role of BDNF, recent studies have reported 
contrasting results, including anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory 
activities. Moreover, BDNF polymorphisms can interfere with BDNF role in pain 
perception. In Val66Met carriers, the Met allele may have a dual role, with 
anti-nociceptive actions in normal condition and pro-nociceptive effects during 
chronic pain. In order to elucidate the main effects of BDNF in nociception, we 
reviewed the main characteristics of this neurotrophin, focusing on its 
involvement in pain.

Neuropathic pain (NP) develops because of damage to the peripheral or central 
nervous system. It results in the hyperalgesia and allodynia. In the recent 
years, various researchers have studied the involvement of neuro-immune system 
in causing persistence of pain. The absence of synaptic contacts in the sensory 
ganglion makes them distinctive in terms of pain related signalling. In sensory 
ganglia, the neurotransmitters or the other modulators such as inflammatory 
substances produced by the ganglion cells, because of an injury, are responsible 
for the cross-excitation between neurons and neuron-glial interaction, thus 
affecting chemical transmission. This chemical transmission is considered mainly 
responsible for the chronicity and the persistent nature of neuropathic pain. 
This review examines the pain signalling due to neurotransmitter or cytokine 
release within the sensory ganglia. The specific areas focused on include: 1) 
the role of neurotransmitters released from the somata of sensory neurons in 
pain, 2) neuron-glia interaction and 3) role of cytokines in neuromodulation and 
pain.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the long-term effect of high-dose spinal cord 
stimulation (HD-SCS) in patients with chronic refractory low back and leg pain 
due to failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS).
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective case series; pilot study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with chronic low back and leg pain (CBLP) due to 
failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) were screened for SCS according to the Dutch 
Neuromodulation Society guidelines. Patients with a pain score of >50 (on a 
visual analogue scale from 0 to 100) for both low back and leg pain, were 
selected for participation in this study. During intraoperative screening one or 
two electrodes were implanted to ensure adequate paresthesia coverage of the 
back and leg pain area. During the 14 days trial period patients received two 
programs: a conventional or low-dose (LD) program with 30 Hz; 390 μsec and a 
high-dose (HD) program with 420 Hz, 400 μsec. They all started with LD-SCS and 
changed to HD-SCS after three days. If patients reported more than 50% pain 
relief with either program a rechargeable neurostimulator was implanted for 
permanent SCS. The scores for low back pain and leg pain were recorded 
separately. Other therapy related outcomes that were collected are pain 
medication use, Quebec back pain disability scale (QBPDS), patient satisfaction, 
employment status, stimulation settings, and adverse events. We present the 6- 
and 12-months results. Results are presented as mean ± SD.
RESULTS: Thirteen patients, nine females and four males (mean age: 49.7 ± 8.1 
years), were included between July 2015 and March 2016. Eleven patients 
responded to SCS during the trial period and were implanted with a 
neurostimulator. Most patients preferred HD-SCS over LD-SCS and the overall use 
of HD-SCS increased over time. At 6 to 12 months follow-up, two patients 
discontinued the study. In one patient low back pain returned despite optimal 
stimulation settings. The second patient was neither satisfied with LD nor HD 
and had the system explanted. VAS Leg pain at baseline was 71.2 ± 33.8 and 
reduced to 25.7 ± 24.0 at 6 months and 23.4 ± 32.0 at 12 months. VAS Back pain 
at baseline was 66.7 ± 33.2 and reduced to 36.8 ± 41.6 at 6 months and 26.1 
± 33.2 at 12 months. Pain medication was significantly reduced and QBPDS 
improved from 59.2 ± 12.2 at baseline to 44.1 ± 13.7 at 12 months. Five patients 
returned to work and overall patient satisfaction at the end of the study was 
high.
CONCLUSION: This pilot study shows promising results of offering HD-SCS in 
addition to LD-SCS for treatment of chronic back and leg pain in patients with 
failed back surgery syndrome.

BACKGROUND: Some 7.7% of the Chinese population suffer from herpes zoster each 
year, with 29.8% proceeding on to develop postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). This 
amounts to over 32 million people per year. PHN is preceded by 2 phases of pain: 
acute herpetic neuralgia (AHN), and subacute herpetic neuralgia (SHN). 
Considering the large individual and economic burden, preventing the transition 
of AHN/SHN to PHN is crucial. However, to date this has been difficult.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of temporary spinal cord stimulation (tSCS) 
treatment and prevention of PHN.
STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective, observational study.
SETTING: Department of Pain Medicine.
METHODS: From 2013 to 2017, 99 patients with AHN (n = 42), SHN (n = 34), and PHN 
(n = 23) underwent tSCS treatment (7-14 days) after failed pharmacologic and 
interventional therapies. Visual analog scale (VAS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality 
Index (PSQI), and analgesic consumption were recorded at baseline, post-tSCS, 
and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after tSCS treatment.
RESULTS: Pooled results demonstrated statistically significant decreases in VAS 
scores and PSQI post-tSCS and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months follow-up (P < 0.001). 
When compared with the PHN group, both AHN and SHN groups were clinically and 
statistically improved in VAS scores and PSQI (P < 0.001). Analgesic consumption 
decreased in all 3 groups after tSCS treatment, and downward linear gradient of 
medication in the AHN group was more significant than that in the SHN and PHN 
groups. At 12 months follow-up, 2.5% (1/40) patients in the AHN group, 16.0% 
(4/25) in the SHN group, and 62.5% (10/16) in the PHN group had ongoing pain >= 
3/10 VAS score requiring analgesia. Expressed differently, at 12 months, 97.5% 
of the AHN group and 84% of the SHN group had pain of 2/10 VAS score or less 
versus only 37.5% of the PHN group.
LIMITATIONS: This was a single-center, retrospective study, which made it 
difficult to collect complete data for all variables. The therapeutic effect of 
tSCS could not be studied independently.
CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective analyses of 99 patients treated with tSCS (7-14 
days) suggests that tSCS may be effective for treating and preventing PHN. Early 
treatment within 4 to 8 weeks was more likely to result in pain <= 2/10 VAS 
score, improvement in sleep, and no requirement for analgesia at 12 months. 
Early tSCS may be a promising prevention strategy against the development of 
chronic neuropathic pain following herpes zoster infection. Further research is 
justified.

Inconsistent findings from migraine neuroimaging studies have limited attempts 
to localize migraine symptomatology. Novel brain network mapping techniques 
offer a new approach for linking neuroimaging findings to a common 
neuroanatomical substrate and localizing therapeutic targets. In this study, we 
attempted to determine whether neuroanatomically heterogeneous neuroimaging 
findings of migraine localize to a common brain network. We used meta-analytic 
coordinates of decreased grey matter volume in migraineurs as seed regions to 
generate resting state functional connectivity network maps from a normative 
connectome (n = 1000). Network maps were overlapped to identify common regions 
of connectivity across all coordinates. Specificity of our findings was 
evaluated using a whole-brain Bayesian spatial generalized linear mixed model 
and a region of interest analysis with comparison groups of chronic pain and a 
neurologic control (Alzheimer's disease). We found that all migraine coordinates 
(11/11, 100%) were negatively connected (t ≥ ±7, P < 10-6 family-wise error 
corrected for multiple comparisons) to a single location in left extrastriate 
visual cortex overlying dorsal V3 and V3A subregions. More than 90% of 
coordinates (10/11) were also positively connected with bilateral insula and 
negatively connected with the hypothalamus. Bayesian spatial generalized linear 
mixed model whole-brain analysis identified left V3/V3A as the area with the 
most specific connectivity to migraine coordinates compared to control 
coordinates (voxel-wise probability of ≥90%). Post hoc region of interest 
analyses further supported the specificity of this finding (ANOVA P = 0.02; 
pairwise t-tests P = 0.03 and P = 0.003, respectively). In conclusion, using 
coordinate-based network mapping, we show that regions of grey matter volume 
loss in migraineurs localize to a common brain network defined by connectivity 
to visual cortex V3/V3A, a region previously implicated in mechanisms of 
cortical spreading depression in migraine. Our findings help unify migraine 
neuroimaging literature and offer a migraine-specific target for neuromodulatory 
treatment.

Background and Purpose: The exhaustion of muscle satellite cells (SCs) is 
correlated with muscle diseases, including sarcopenia and Duchenne muscular 
dystrophy. Exercise benefits skeletal muscle homeostasis and promotes 
proliferation of SCs. Elucidating the molecular mechanism underlying the muscle 
function-improving effect of exercise has important implications in regenerative 
medicine. Methods: Herein, we investigated the effect of 4-week treadmill 
training on skeletal muscle and SCs in mice. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining 
was utilized to detect the morphometry of skeletal muscles. Flow cytometry and 
immunofluorescence were conducted to analyze the abundance and cell cycle of 
SCs. RNA sequencing was performed to elucidate the transcriptional regulatory 
network of SCs. The ChIP-PCR assay was used to detect enrichment of H3K27ac at 
the promoters of Akt. Results: We observed that exercise resulted in muscle 
hypertrophy and improved muscle regeneration in mice. Unexpectedly, exercise 
promoted cell cycling but suppressed the Akt-mTOR pathway in SCs. Proliferative 
SCs in "exercised mice" required suppressed mTOR activity to limit mitochondrial 
metabolism, maintaining the "limited activation status" of SCs against 
exhaustion. Mechanistically, exercise upregulated the expression of Igfbp7, 
thereby impeding the phosphorylation of Akt and resulting in inhibited mTOR 
activity and limited mitochondrial metabolism. The limited mitochondrial 
metabolism resulted in hypoacetylation of histone 3 and reduced enrichment of 
H3K27ac at promoters of Akt, decreasing the transcription of Akt. Moreover, 
repeatedly injured mice showed a preserved SC pool and improved muscle 
regeneration by the suppression of Akt-mTOR signaling. Conclusions: The findings 
of our study show that exercise protects proliferative SCs against exhaustion 
via the Igfbp7-Akt-mTOR axis. These findings establish a link between mechanical 
signaling, mitochondrial metabolism, epigenetic modification, and stem cell fate 
decisions; thus, present potential therapeutic targets for muscle diseases 
correlated with SC exhaustion.

Neuromodulation in primary headaches: current evidence and integration into 
clinical practice.

Center Rostock, Rostock, Germany.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Neuromodulatory approaches add to our armamentarium of 
therapeutic tools for the treatment of primary headaches. This review provides a 
comprehensive overview of current controlled studies on the different 
neuromodulation techniques and recommendations for clinical practice.
RECENT FINDINGS: Evidence for efficacy of transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation 
(tVNS) is limited to acute use in migraine with ambiguous results and episodic 
cluster headache as well as chronic cluster headache if applied in addition to 
conventional treatment. Transcutaneous stimulation of the supraorbital and 
supratrochlear nerve was effective in both acute and preventive stimulation (the 
latter with ambiguous results) in episodic migraines. Thus, invasive procedures 
should be reserved for severe and refractory cases only. Occipital nerve 
stimulation for chronic refractory cluster headache is the only available 
invasive approach with a Conformité Européenne mark.
SUMMARY: Neuromodulation can complement conventional therapy, with noninvasive 
procedures being used preferably. Given the limited number of studies for each 
modality and the lack of head-to-head studies, it is difficult to place 
neuromodulation techniques in a conventional treatment algorithm.

Antineoplastic therapy has been associated with pain syndrome development 
characterized by acute and chronic pain. The chemotherapeutic agent dacarbazine, 
used mainly to treat metastatic melanoma, is reported to cause painful symptoms, 
compromising patient quality of life. Evidence has proposed that transient 
receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) plays a critical role in 
chemotherapy-induced pain syndrome. Here, we investigated whether dacarbazine 
causes painful hypersensitivity in naive or melanoma-bearing mice and the 
involvement of TRPA1 in these models. Mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons 
and human TRPA1-transfected HEK293 (hTRPA1-HEK293) cells were used to evaluate 
the TRPA1-mediated calcium response evoked by dacarbazine. Mechanical and cold 
allodynia were evaluated after acute or repeated dacarbazine administration in 
naive mice or after inoculation of B16-F10 melanoma cells in C57BL/6 mice. TRPA1 
involvement was investigated by using pharmacological and genetic tools 
(selective antagonist or antisense oligonucleotide treatment and Trpa1 knockout 
mice). Dacarbazine directly activated TRPA1 in hTRPA1-HEK293 cells and mouse DRG 
neurons and appears to sensitize TRPA1 indirectly by generating oxidative stress 
products. Moreover, dacarbazine caused mechanical and cold allodynia in naive 
but not Trpa1 knockout mice. Also, dacarbazine-induced nociception was reduced 
by the pharmacological TRPA1 blockade (antagonism), antioxidants, and by 
ablation of TRPA1 expression. TRPA1 pharmacological blockade also reduced 
dacarbazine-induced nociception in a tumor-associated pain model. Thus, 
dacarbazine causes nociception by TRPA1 activation, indicating that this 
receptor may represent a pharmacological target for treating 
chemotherapy-induced pain syndrome in cancer patients submitted to 
antineoplastic treatment with dacarbazine.

Chronic low back pain (cLBP) is a prevalent disorder. A growing body of evidence 
linking the pathology of the reward network to chronic pain suggests that pain 
sensitization may contribute to cLBP chronification via disruptions of 
mesocortical and mesolimbic circuits in the reward system. Resting-state (RS) 
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data was acquired from 90 patients 
with cLBP and 74 matched pain-free controls (HCs) at baseline and after a 
manipulation for back pain intensification. The ventral tegmental area (VTA) was 
chosen as a seed region to perform RS functional connectivity (FC) analysis. 
Baseline rsFC of both the mesocortical (between the VTA and bilateral rostral 
anterior cingulate cortex (rACC)/and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)) and 
mesolimbic (between the VTA and bilateral hippocampus/parahippocampus) pathways 
was reduced in patients with cLBP (vs. HCs). In addition, patients exhibiting 
higher back pain intensity (compared to the relatively lower back pain intensity 
condition) also showed increases in both mesocortical and mesolimbic 
connectivity, implicating these pathways in pain downregulation in cLBP. 
Mediation analysis further isolated the mesolimbic 
(VTA-hippocampus/parahippocampus) dysconnectivity as a neural mechanism 
mediating the association between mechanical pain sensitivity (indexed by P40 
pressure) and cLBP severity. In sum, the current study demonstrates deficient 
mesocorticolimbic connectivity in cLBP, with mesolimbic dysconnectivity 
potentially mediating the contribution of pain sensitization to pain 
chronification. These reward network dysfunctions and purportedly, dopaminergic 
dysregulations, may help us to identify key brain targets of neuromodulation in 
the treatment of cLBP.

Total knee arthroplasty is a common and successful treatment modality for knee 
arthritis that is refractory to conservative management strategies. Over 600,000 
arthroplasties are performed per year in the United States, and this number is 
expected to increase in the coming years. Unfortunately, 8% to 34% of patients 
experience chronic pain after having a total knee arthroplasty. These patients 
should undergo an appropriate work-up by the orthopedic surgeon, but many times 
a surgical problem is not uncovered. In these situations, a thorough and 
specific plan for pain management should be sought. In this article, we outline 
the work-up of a painful total knee arthroplasty. Then we provide a thorough 
review of interventional pain management strategies and highlight the pertinent 
literature. Lastly, we hypothesize future developments in the field that may 
provide better outcomes for patients suffering from painful total knee 
arthroplasty.

INTRODUCTION: Due to the difficulties encountered in the treatment process of 
patients with chronic pain, it is of utmost importance to involve patients 
themselves in their rehabilitation trajectory. Patient engagement can be 
obtained by motivating patients to select their own treatment goals. We 
hypothesize that applying goal setting, as a form of patient empowerment, in 
potential candidates for spinal cord stimulation (SCS) may further improve the 
outcome of SCS. As a first step in creating patient empowerment, patients' goals 
that they aim to achieve with SCS will be explored.
METHODS: Fifteen patients suffering from failed back/neck surgery syndrome and 
scheduled for SCS were interviewed in depth. All interviews were audio recorded 
and analyzed using in vivo coding. Afterwards, the International Classification 
of Functioning, Disability and Health framework was used to structure the 
responses of patients.
RESULTS: In the domain of bodily functions, all patients mentioned pain 
reduction, and 1 patient wanted to regain his previous sleep pattern. In the 
domain of activities, walking, sitting, driving a car, bending down, and picking 
up were the highest ranked goals. Regaining a social life was the highest ranked 
goal for participation. Eleven patients wanted to regain a feeling of happiness, 
and 5 patients wanted to focus on avoiding depression.
CONCLUSION: The interviews revealed a broad spectrum of individual patients' 
goals, highlighting the need of individually targeted rehabilitation 
trajectories in the field of neuromodulation. Goal identification could entail 
the first step towards individualized medicine in the SCS trajectory.

PURPOSE: Evaluation of clinical and radiological effects of the therapeutic 
outcome of CT-guided pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) treatment adjacent to the 
lumbar dorsal root ganglion (DRG) for patients with chronic intractable 
lumbosacral radicular pain in a single-center prospective longitudinal study in 
order to evaluate predictive factors of safety and therapeutic success.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients, from 2016 to 2018, were enrolled (age: 
42-80 aa, 66.7% men and 33.3% females) with low back pain, lumbosciatalgia 
and/or lumbocruralgia, resistant to previous medical and physical treatments for 
a period not < 3 months, failure of surgical and chemiodiscolysis with ozone 
oxygen therapy. Each patient was subjected to a clinical evaluation (antalgic 
walking, sensitive deficit, interviews with specific questionnaires: ODI, 
RDQ,VAS) and to a radiological evaluation with MRI examination, before and 
30 days after the CT-guided PRF treatment. Measurements of the thickness of the 
involved and not involved DRG were taken using common postprocessing software of 
MRI examinations in order to have measurement parameters for comparison. We 
analyzed the clinical course using the paired samples T test in order to 
evaluate modification for each clinical and radiological parameter (statistical 
significance p < 0.05).
RESULTS: Significant improvements of the clinical outcomes with a good 
resolution of the pain symptoms (VAS evaluation: The score fell from 68.47 to 
39.17 with a difference of 29.3 and a reduction of the 42.79% in the perceived 
pain, p = 0.00000152). The thickness of DRG falls from an average media of 
0.586-0.448 cm (p = 0.000085), with a difference of 0.138 cm and a percentage 
reduction of 22.30%.
CONCLUSIONS: PRF treatment of the DRG may be considered for patients with 
chronic severe lumbosacral radicular pain refractory to conventional medical 
management when other noninvasive or surgical procedures fail. It is minimally 
invasive, inexpensive and simple to perform with no complications.

Self-compassion is associated with disability, pain-related anxiety as well as 
depression and anger in patients with chronic pain. However, the unique value of 
self-compassion versus other concepts such as psychological flexibility and 
self-esteem is unknown. The present study therefore aimed to clarify these 
relationships. Individuals with chronic pain (NCP = 872) and without chronic 
pain (NNP = 356) took part in a longitudinal study. Participants completed 
self-report instruments: Pain Disability Index (PDI), Pain Catastrophizing Scale 
(PCS), Pain Anxiety Symptom Scale (PASS-20), Patient Health Questionnaire 
(PHQ-9), State Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI), Self-Compassion Scale 
(SCS), Psychological Inflexibility in Pain Scale (PIPS) and Rosenberg 
Self-Esteem Scale (RSES). Assessments were repeated after 8 weeks. We found 
differences in baseline levels of all relevant variables except for anger-out 
and anger-control between people with and without chronic pain. Subsequently, we 
computed a path model analysis regarding individuals suffering from chronic pain 
(NCP), addressing the predictive value of reduced uncompassionate 
self-responding (RUS), compassionate self-responding (CS), avoidance (PIPS), 
cognitive fusion (PIPS) and self-esteem (RSES) regarding pain-related (PDI, PCS, 
PASS) and emotional variables (PHQ-9, STAXI). Avoidance predicted disability, 
catastrophizing, anxiety and depression. RUS predicted catastrophizing and 
pain-related anxiety. Self-esteem predicted depression. CS and cognitive fusion 
had no unique predictive value. The model explained 65.4%-72.1% of the variance 
in pain-related variables, 68.7% of the variance in depression and 38.7%-60.7% 
in the variance of anger-related variables. In conclusion, psychological 
flexibility, in terms of avoidance, seems to be more relevant for chronic pain 
than self-compassion. Future research should focus on subgroups and 
tailored-treatment approaches. SIGNIFICANCE: Applying a longitudinal design, 
this study examined the predictive value of self-compassion regarding pain, 
depression and anger. The relevance of self-compassion was compared to 
psychological flexibility and self-esteem. We can conclude that psychological 
flexibility, in terms of avoidance behaviour, is the most relevant predictor 
concerning pain.

INTRODUCTION: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive 
neuromodulation technique that has been widely studied for the treatment of 
chronic pain. It is considered a promising and safe alternative pain therapy. 
Different targets have been tested, each having their own particular mechanisms 
for modulating pain perception.
AREAS COVERED: We discuss the current state of the art of tDCS to manage pain 
and future strategies to optimize tDCS' effects. Current strategies include 
primary motor cortex tDCS, prefrontal tDCS and tDCS combined with behavioral 
interventions while future strategies, on the other hand, include high-intensity 
tDCS, transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation, cerebellar tDCS, 
home-based tDCS, and tDCS with extended number of sessions.
EXPERT COMMENTARY: It has been shown that the stimulation of the prefrontal and 
primary motor cortex is efficient for pain reduction while a few other new 
strategies, such as high-intensity tDCS and network-based tDCS, are believed to 
induce strong neuroplastic effects, although the underlying neural mechanisms 
still need to be fully uncovered. Hence, conventional tDCS approaches 
demonstrated promising effects to manage pain and new strategies are under 
development to enhance tDCS effects and make this approach more easily available 
by using, for instance, home-based devices.

Chronic pain is a common condition that affects the physical, emotional, and 
mental well-being of patients and can significantly diminish their quality of 
life. Due to growing concerns about the substantial risks of long-term opioid 
use, both governmental agencies and professional societies have recommended 
prioritizing the use of nonpharmacologic treatments, when suitable, in order to 
reduce or eliminate the need for opioid use. The use of 10 kHz spinal cord 
stimulation (10 kHz SCS) is one such nonpharmacologic alternative for the 
treatment of chronic, intractable pain of the trunk and limbs. This review 
examines published clinical data regarding the efficacy of 10 kHz SCS for 
decreasing chronic pain in patients and its potential to reduce or eliminate 
opioid usage. Multiple prospective and retrospective studies in patients with 
intractable pain demonstrated that 10 kHz SCS treatment provided ≥50% pain 
relief in >70% patients after at least 1 year of treatment. Pain relief with 
10 kHz SCS therapy ranged from 54% to 87% in the studies. More importantly, the 
mean daily dose of opioids required by patients in these studies was reduced 
after 10 kHz SCS treatment, and on average over 60% patients in studies either 
reduced or eliminated opioids at the last follow-up.

OBJECTIVES: The recent availability of paraesthesia/sensation free spinal cord 
stimulation (SCS) modalities allow the design of clinical trials of SCS using 
placebo/sham controls and blinding of patients, clinicians, and researchers. The 
aims of this study were to: 1) systematically review the current evidence base 
of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of SCS placebo/sham trials and 2) to 
undertake a methodological critique of their methods. Based on this critique, we 
developed a checklist for the design and reporting of future RCTs of SCS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Electronic data bases were searched from inception until 
January 2019 for RCTs of SCS using a placebo/sham control. RCTs with only an 
active comparator arm were excluded. The results are presented as a narrative 
synthesis.
RESULTS: Searches identified 12 eligible RCTs. SCS modalities included 
paraesthesia stimulation, subthreshold, burst, and high-frequency SCS and were 
mainly conducted in patients with failed back surgery syndrome, complex regional 
pain syndrome, and refractory angina. The quality and transparency of reporting 
of the methods of placebo stimulation, blinding of patients, clinicians, and 
researchers varied markedly across studies.
CONCLUSIONS: To date the methods of placebo/sham control and blinding in RCTs 
have been poorly reported, leading to concerns about the validity and 
replicability of the findings. Important aspects that need to be clearly 
reported in the design of placebo-/sham-controlled RCTs of SCS include the 
transparent reporting of stimulation programming parameters, patient position 
during perception threshold measurement, management of the patient handheld 
programmer, frequency of recharging, and assessment of the fidelity of blinding.

Morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G), the main metabolite of morphine, has been 
implicated in the development of tolerance and of opioid-induced hyperalgesia, 
both limiting the analgesic use of morphine. We evaluated the acute and chronic 
effects of M3G and morphine as well as development of antinociceptive 
cross-tolerance between morphine and M3G after intrathecal administration and 
assessed the expression of pain-associated neurotransmitter substance P in the 
spinal cord. Sprague-Dawley rats received intrathecal M3G or morphine twice 
daily for 6 days. Nociception and tactile allodynia were measured with von Frey 
filaments after acute and chronic treatments. Substance P levels in the dorsal 
horn of the spinal cord were determined by immunohistochemistry after 4-day 
treatments. Acute morphine caused antinociception as expected, whereas acute M3G 
caused tactile allodynia, as did both chronic M3G and morphine. Chronic M3G also 
induced antinociceptive cross-tolerance to morphine. M3G and morphine increased 
substance P levels similarly in the nociceptive laminae of the spinal cord. This 
study shows that chronic intrathecal M3G sensitises animals to mechanical 
stimulation and elevates substance P levels in the nociceptive laminae of the 
spinal cord. Chronic M3G also induces antinociceptive cross-tolerance to 
morphine. Thus, chronic M3G exposure might contribute to morphine-induced 
tolerance and opioid-induced hyperalgesia.

INTRODUCTION: Percutaneous peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) provides an 
opportunity to relieve chronic low back pain and reduce opioid analgesic 
consumption as an alternative to radiofrequency ablation and permanently 
implanted neurostimulation systems. Traditionally, the use of neurostimulation 
earlier in the treatment continuum has been limited by its associated risk, 
invasiveness, and cost.
METHODS: Percutaneous PNS leads (SPRINT MicroLead) were placed bilaterally to 
target the medial branches of the dorsal rami nerves under image guidance. The 
percutaneous leads were connected to miniature wearable stimulators (SPRINT PNS 
System) for the 1-month therapy period, after which the leads were removed. Pain 
and disability were assessed long-term up to 12 months after lead removal.
RESULTS: Substantial, clinically significant reductions in average pain 
intensity (≥50% reduction as measured by the Brief Pain Inventory Short Form) 
were experienced by a majority of subjects (67%) at end of treatment compared to 
baseline (average 80% reduction among responders; P < 0.05, analysis of 
variance; n = 9). Twelve months after the end of PNS treatment, a majority of 
subjects who completed the long-term follow-up visits experienced sustained, 
clinically significant reductions in pain and/or disability (67%, n = 6; average 
63% reduction in pain intensity and 32-point reduction in disability among 
responders). No serious or unanticipated adverse events were reported.
CONCLUSIONS: This study challenges the long-held notion that a positive trial of 
PNS should be followed by a permanent implant in responders. Percutaneous PNS 
may serve as an effective neurostimulation therapy for patients with chronic low 
back pain and should be considered earlier in the treatment continuum as a 
motor-sparing means of avoiding opioids, denervation, and permanently implanted 
neurostimulation systems.

OBJECTIVES: Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a recognized treatment for chronic 
pain. This systematic review aims to assess economic evaluations of SCS for the 
management of all chronic pain conditions, summarize key findings, and assess 
the quality of studies to inform healthcare resource allocation decisions and 
future research.
METHODS: Economic evaluations were identified by searching general medical and 
economic databases complemented with screening of reference lists of identified 
studies. No restrictions on language or treatment comparators were applied. 
Relevant data were extracted. The quality of included studies was assessed using 
the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) 
checklist.
RESULTS: Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria and were judged to be of 
acceptable quality. Economic evaluations assessed SCS for the management of 
refractory angina pectoris, failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS), complex 
regional pain syndrome (CRPS), diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), and 
peripheral arterial disease. Model-based studies typically applied a 2-stage 
model, i.e. decision tree followed by Markov model. Time horizon varied from 1 
year to lifetime. Cost-effectiveness ranged widely from dominant (SCS 
cost-saving and more effective) to incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 
>£100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. Cost-effectiveness appeared to depend 
on the time horizon, choice of comparator, and indication. Ten of the studies 
indicated SCS as cost-saving or cost-effective compared with the alternative 
strategies.
CONCLUSION: The results consistently suggest that SCS is cost-effective when 
considering a long-term time horizon, particularly for the management of FBSS 
and CRPS. Further studies are needed to assess the cost-effectiveness of SCS for 
ischemic pain and DPN.

INTRODUCTION: Dorsal root ganglion stimulation (DRG-S) is a neuromodulation 
technique for treating neuropathic pain syndromes. Research has demonstrated 
DRG-S to be more effective than conventional SCS in treating RSD/CRPS, 
particularly of the lower extremities. Results from recent case series and 
prospective studies suggest that DRG-S may be effective in treatment of pain 
syndromes considered to have non-neuropathic components and characteristics 
(e.g. nociceptive). There have been multiple, small studies demonstrating 
efficacy of DRG-S for axial low back pain. There has, however, been no consensus 
regarding the best location for DRG lead placement in the treatment of low back 
pain.
METHODS: Patients presenting with refractory low back pain in a private pain 
management practice were considered for DRG-S. Patients were provided a trial 
stimulator prior to potential implantation. Per standard practice, pain 
intensity, disability, general health status, and quality of life were followed 
using the visual analog scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index, EQ-5D index, and 
the SF-36 survey, respectively. Data were collected prior to implantation and at 
variable follow-ups after DRG-S initiation.
RESULTS: Seventeen consecutive patients presented with predominantly axial low 
back pain with/without a secondary component of lower extremity pain. All were 
trialed and subsequently implanted for DRG-S. Leads were placed at T12 to target 
the low back. Stimulation levels were set very low, below that of which patients 
experienced paresthesias. Last follow-up times averaged 8.3 months. More than 
half of the patients experienced pain relief ≥80%, with an average low back pain 
relief of 78% at last follow-up. Additionally, substantial improvements in 
physical and mental functioning, disability, and quality of life were reported.
CONCLUSIONS: T12 DRG-S can be an effective treatment for chronic axial low back 
pain. Stimulation results in reduced pain and disability, while improving 
quality of life. These outcomes can be achieved without paresthesias.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Inflammation has been associated with a number of 
pathological conditions including intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration, 
increased risks of low back pain and other spinal diseases. Downregulating disc 
inflammation may be a strategy to reduce degeneration and more importantly back 
pain. Interleukin (IL)-4 was first discovered as a T-cell secreted factor that 
enhanced the proliferation of anti-IgM stimulated B cells and is now known as a 
cytokine that can stimulate cell proliferation and differentiation, tissue 
regeneration and neurological functions. IL-4 has been shown to be effective in 
inhibiting inflammatory pathways in chondrocytes. Immunohistochemical studies 
have shown that disc tissues are immunopositive for IL-4 receptor α (IL-4Rα) and 
IL-4. Yet, the roles of IL-4 and IL-4R in disc biology remain unknown.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to understand the roles of IL-4 and IL-4Rα 
in IVDs and to determine if IL-4 can function to inhibit inflammation in IVD 
cells.
STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: In vitro experiment.
METHODS: Deidentified patient IVD tissues were collected after surgery under the 
Orthopedic Information, Tissue and Implant Repository (ORA L00011021). IVD cells 
were isolated and cultured in monolayer. IL-4R protein expression was analyzed 
using immunocytochemistry. To test if the IL-4R was responsive to its ligand, 
signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) phosphorylation was 
analyzed on cell lysates of IVD cells treated with recombinant human IL-4 for 30 
minutes using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay kit. Gene expression analysis of 
IL-4 up- and downregulated genes were analyzed using real-time RT-PCR. 
Anti-inflammatory effects of IL-4 were determined by cotreating disc cells with 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and IL-4 and measuring gene expression and protein 
release of inflammatory markers, IL-6 and IL-8. The significance of differences 
among means of data on gene expression and protein analyses were analyzed by 
one-way analysis of variance or student t test. Differences were considered 
significant when the p value was below 0.05.
RESULTS: Immunocytochemistry staining for IL-4Rα in primary IVD cells (n=8) 
showed the majority of immunopositive staining was intracellular. After IVD 
cells (n=3-7) were treated with different concentrations of recombinant human 
IL-4 (0.1-100 ng/mL) for 30 minutes, phospho-STAT6 levels significantly 
increased by two- to four-fold at all concentrations tested compared with 
untreated cells. Gene expression of IL-4Rα and IL-6 increased significantly in 
cells undergoing IL-4 treatment for 24 hours compared with control treated IVD 
cells (n=5-10). LPS stimulated inflammatory gene expression of interferon 
(IFN)β, IL-12, IL-6, and IL-8 were downregulated significantly in the presence 
of IL-4 (n=7). Lastly, protein release of IL-6 and IL-8 were reduced 
significantly in cells treated with IL-4 and LPS compared with those treated 
with LPS alone (n=7).
CONCLUSIONS: This study was the first to explore the function of IL-4 and IL-4R 
in IVD cells. Immunocytochemistry studies confirmed that the majority of cells 
isolated from patient IVDs expressed IL-4Rα at the protein level. Also, IVD 
cells can respond to IL-4 by up-regulating IL-4Rα and IL-6 genes and inhibiting 
inflammatory genes and proteins induced by LPS. Further studies to test the 
anti-inflammatory effects of IL-4 in the IVD would be needed in animal models.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Biological therapies which include intradiscal delivery of 
cells, anti-inflammatories or growth factors are being investigated to treat 
disc degeneration and back pain in animal models and in the clinic. Based on our 
findings that IL-4 has anti-inflammatory effects on IVD cells, the results of 
this study suggest including recombinant IL-4 delivery into the intervertebral 
disc may be a beneficial therapeutic strategy to treat patients with back pain 
by reducing disc inflammation.

A postsynaptic dysfunction of the neuromuscular junction has been reported in 
patients with alpha-dystroglycanopathy associated with mutations in guanosine 
diphosphate (GDP)-mannose pyrophosphorylase B gene (GMPPB), some of whom benefit 
from symptomatic treatment. In this study, we determine the frequency of 
myasthenic and fatigue symptoms and neuromuscular junction transmission defects 
in a fukutin-related protein (FKRP)-predominant alpha-dystroglycanopathy cohort. 
Thirty-one patients with alpha-dystroglycanopathies due to mutations in FKRP 
(n = 25), GMPPB (n = 4), POMGNT1 (n = 1), and POMT2 (n = 1) completed a 
six-question modified questionnaire for myasthenic symptoms and the PROMIS Short 
Form v1.0-Fatigue 8a survey, and they underwent 3 Hz repetitive nerve 
stimulation of spinal accessory nerve-trapezius and radial nerve-anconeus pairs. 
Results showed that fatigue with activity was common; 63% of the cohort reported 
fatigue with chewing. A defective postsynaptic neuromuscular junction 
transmission was not identified in any of the patients carrying FKRP mutations 
but only in one mildly affected patient with GMPPB mutations (c.79 G>C, p.D27H 
and c.402+1G>A, splice site variant). We conclude that symptoms of fatigue with 
activity did not predict abnormal neuromuscular junction transmission on 
electrodiagnostic studies in this cohort and that, unlike GMPPB subgroup, a 
defective neuromuscular junction transmission does not appear to be present in 
patients with FKRP-associated muscular dystrophies.

Effective, non-addictive therapeutics for chronic pain remain a critical need. 
While there are several potential therapeutics that stimulate anti-inflammatory 
mechanisms to restore homeostasis in the spinal dorsal horn microenvironment, 
the effectiveness of drugs for neuropathic pain are still inadequate. The 
convergence of increasing knowledge about the multi-factorial mechanisms 
underlying neuropathic pain and the mechanisms of drug action from preclinical 
studies are providing the ability to create pharmaceuticals with better clinical 
effectiveness. By targeting and activating the peroxisome proliferator-activated 
receptor gamma subunit (PPARγ), numerous preclinical studies report pleiotropic 
effects of thiazolidinediones (TDZ) beyond their intended use of increasing 
insulin, including their anti-inflammatory, renal, cardioprotective, and 
oncopreventative effects. Several studies find TDZs reduce pain-related 
behavioral symptoms, including ongoing secondary hypersensitivity driven by 
central sensitization. Previous studies find increased PPARγ in the spinal cord 
and brain regions innervated by incoming afferent nerve endings after the 
induction of neuropathic pain models. PPARγ agonist treatment provides an 
effective reduction in pain-related behaviors, including anxiety. Data further 
suggest that improved brain mitochondrial bioenergetics after PPARγ agonist 
treatment is a key mechanism for reducing hypersensitivity. This review 
emphasizes two points relevant for the development of better chronic pain 
therapies. First, employing neuropathic pain models with chronic duration is 
critical since they can encompass the continuum of molecular and brain circuitry 
alterations arising over time when pain persists, providing greater relevance to 
clinical pain syndromes. Assisting in that effort are preclinical models of 
chronic trigeminal pain syndromes. Secondly, considering the access to nerve and 
brain neurons and glia across the blood-brain barrier is important. While many 
therapies have low brain penetrance, a PPARγ agonist with better brain 
penetrance, ELB00824, has been developed. Purposeful design and recent 
comparative testing indicate that ELB00824 is extraordinarily efficient and 
efficacious. ELB00824 provides greatly improved attenuation of pain-related 
behaviors, including mechanical hypersensitivity, anxiety, and depression in our 
chronic trigeminal nerve injury models. Physiochemical properties allowing 
significant brain access and toxicity testing are discussed.

Mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) enzymes associate in supercomplexes (SCs) 
that are structurally interdependent. This may explain why defects in a single 
component often produce combined enzyme deficiencies in patients. A case in 
point is the alleged destabilization of complex I in the absence of complex III. 
To clarify the structural and functional relationships between complexes, we 
have used comprehensive proteomic, functional, and biogenetical approaches to 
analyze a MT-CYB-deficient human cell line. We show that the absence of complex 
III blocks complex I biogenesis by preventing the incorporation of the NADH 
module rather than decreasing its stability. In addition, complex IV subunits 
appeared sequestered within complex III subassemblies, leading to defective 
complex IV assembly as well. Therefore, we propose that complex III is central 
for MRC maturation and SC formation. Our results challenge the notion that SC 
biogenesis requires the pre-formation of fully assembled individual complexes. 
In contrast, they support a cooperative-assembly model in which the main role of 
complex III in SCs is to provide a structural and functional platform for the 
completion of overall MRC biogenesis.

BACKGROUND: The nociceptive flexion reflex (NFR) is a spinal reflex induced by 
painful stimuli resulting in an appropriate withdrawal response. The NFR is 
considered to be an objective physiological correlate of spinal nociception. 
Previous research has already demonstrated that physical activity (PA) can 
influence pain assessments. To date, no studies have directly examined the 
relationship between PA and spinal nociception. Hence, this study aimed to 
investigate whether the NFR threshold can be predicted by report-based and 
monitor-based measures of PA in healthy adults.
METHODS: PA and the NFR threshold of 58 healthy adults were assessed. PA was 
evaluated by self-report using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire 
and by monitor-based accelerometry data. The NFR threshold was elicited through 
transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the sural nerve and quantified by the 
biceps femoris muscle electromyogram. Hierarchical linear regression analyses 
were performed to determine the relationship between PA and the NFR, while 
controlling for confounders.
RESULTS: Monitor-based measured step count and activities of moderate- to 
vigorous-intensity predicted the NFR threshold accounting for 23.0% (p = .047) 
to 37.1% (p = .002) of the variance. Larger amounts of step counts and higher 
participation in moderate- to vigorous-intensity activities predicted higher NFR 
thresholds. Monitor-based activities of sedentary intensity predicted the NFR 
threshold accounting for 35.8% (p = .014) to 35.9% (p = .014) of the variance. 
Spending more time per day on activities of sedentary intensity predicted lower 
NFR thresholds.
CONCLUSIONS: The study provides preliminary evidence indicating that a 
physically active lifestyle may reduce spinal nociception in healthy adults, 
while a sedentary lifestyle enhances spinal nociception.
SIGNIFICANCE: The present study provides preliminary evidence that the 
influencing effects of physical activity on pain are the result of a strong 
descending control and do not purely rely on supraspinal mechanisms. These study 
results highlight the importance of considering physical activity levels when 
evaluating nociceptive processing, given the prognostic value of physical 
activity in spinal nociception. Furthermore, this study encourages future 
research to examine the effects of moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise 
programmes on spinal nociception in chronic pain populations.

OBJECTIVES: We aim to investigate the correlation of smoking and spinal cord 
stimulation (SCS) effectiveness for pain relief in complex regional pain 
syndrome (CRPS) patients while controlling for possible confounding factors 
including opioid intake.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following Institutional Review Board approval, a 
retrospective cohort study was performed by collecting data for all CRPS 
patients treated with SCS at Cleveland Clinic between 1998 and 2013. We divided 
patients into three groups based on their smoking status at the time of SCS 
device implant: Current smokers, former smokers, or nonsmokers. We used a linear 
mixed modeling to assess the association between smoking status and pain score 
at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months. We then used pairwise t-tests for 
post hoc comparisons of pain scores.
RESULTS: Of the 420 CRPS patients treated with SCS implants, the reduction in 
pain score was highest among nonsmokers. Nonsmokers demonstrated a consistent 
and steady decrease in pain scores over time, whereas the current and former 
smoker cohorts showed an initial reduction in pain at three months compared to 
baseline which was not sustained to the 12-months benchmark. Nonetheless, former 
smokers continued to report slightly lower pain scores than current smokers, 
although not statistically significant. The baseline opioid consumption was 
least among nonsmokers (30 [0, 62] oral mg morphine sulfate equivalent). We also 
found a statistically significant association between time postimplant and 
reported pain score (χ2 = 508.88, p < 0.001). The overall mean pain score for 
all three cohorts was highest at baseline (7.6 ± 1.7) and showed a decrease at 
the 3, 6, and 12 months postimplant time points with mean score of 5.7 ± 2.0, 
5.6 ± 2.3, and 5.4 ± 2.5, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Tobacco cigarette smoking was associated with reduced SCS 
effectiveness for pain relief.

BACKGROUND: "Traditional" spinal cord stimulation (SCS) trials with percutaneous 
electrodes externalized to a pulse generator (PG) are typically limited in 
duration due to risk of infection. Newer miniaturized wireless SCS technology 
eliminates the percutaneous extension (as well as PGs implanted for chronic 
use), thus facilitating a single-stage implantation after which the device can 
remain indefinitely.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate fully implanted wireless SCS devices during a 30-day 
screening trial in subjects with chronic low back pain and leg pain and a 
history of lumbosacral spine surgery.
METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial of single-stage wireless SCS using a 
wireless percutaneous system, 99 subjects received either 10 kHz high frequency 
stimulation (HFS) or lower frequency stimulation (LFS) below 1500 Hz (Bolash R, 
Creamer M, Rauck R, et al. Wireless high frequency spinal cord stimulation 
(10 kHz) compared to multi-waveform low frequency spinal cord stimulation in the 
management of chronic pain in failed back surgery syndrome subjects: preliminary 
results of a multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled study. Pain Med 
2019, https://doi.org/10.1093/pm/pnz019). In this report, we assess the 30-day 
trial success rate (≥50% pain relief from baseline) and complications.
RESULTS: The overall trial success rate was 88% (87/99): 92% (46/50) for HFS and 
84% (41/49) for LFS (NS). The trial success rate in the 64 subjects with 
predominant low back pain was 92% (59/64) vs. 80% (28/35) in those with leg 
pain ≥ low back pain (NS). During the screening trial, one infection occurred 
(1%) and one subject withdrew and was explanted (1%). Electrode migrations were 
seen on routine follow-up x-rays in 10 cases (10%).
CONCLUSION: Using wireless SCS devices that allow for an extended trial period 
and evaluation of various waveforms, we observed a high rate trial success rate 
with both HFS and LFS waveforms, with minimal incidence of infection. Long-term 
follow-up will address the cost-effectiveness and morbidity associated with this 
technology, which facilitates single-stage treatment.

BACKGROUND: Chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP) can be caused by peripheral nerve 
injury (PNI) resulting from surgical procedures and has a significant 
neuropathic component. This prospective, single-arm study was conducted to 
document the effectiveness of 10-kHz spinal cord stimulation (10-kHz SCS) as a 
treatment for patients with CPSP.
METHODS: Subjects with CPSP who were refractory to conventional medical 
interventions and reported pain scores of ≥5 cm on a 10-cm VAS underwent trial 
stimulations lasting up to 14 days. Epidural leads were implanted at locations 
appropriate for the primary area of pain, and trials resulting in ≥40% pain 
relief were considered successful. Subjects with successful trials underwent 
implantation with a permanent 10-kHz SCS system and were followed for 12 months 
after implantation.
RESULTS: Of the 34 subjects who underwent trial stimulation, 1 was withdrawn 
early and 29 (87.9%) had a successful trial and received a permanent implant. 
After 12 months of treatment, the mean VAS score decreased by 6.5 cm, the 
response rate was 88.0% (22/25), and 18 subjects (62.1%) were remitters with VAS 
scores sustained at ≤3.0 cm. Scores for all components of the short-form McGill 
Pain Questionnaire 2 were significantly reduced, including affective descriptors 
of pain. Pain catastrophizing and vigilance, patient function, physical and 
mental well-being, and sleep quality all improved over the course of the study. 
No neurologic deficits reported in the study.
CONCLUSIONS: 10-kHz SCS is effective and tolerated in patients with CPSP, and 
further study of its clinical application in this population is warranted.

Individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) often experience chronic pain as a 
secondary complication. It can significantly impair mental health, sleep, mood, 
and overall quality of life. It is important for providers within a primary care 
setting to recognize the different types of pain such as nociceptive and 
neuropathic. Various assessment tools are available to guide proper 
classification and subsequent management. Providers need to have a good 
knowledge base, structure, and patient focus when managing care. 
Nonpharmacological interventions are just as important and should be explored 
prior to or along with pharmacological interventions. Treatment modalities such 
as physical therapy, exercise, acupuncture, and cognitive behavioral therapy 
should be tailored to the individual to the greatest extent possible. 
Gabapentin, pregabalin, and amitriptyline have been studied extensively and are 
the first-line pharmacological agents for neuropathic pain. It is important to 
involve patients as equal stakeholders in any pain intervention with adequate 
lifelong follow-up. The aim of this article is to offer an overview of pain 
assessment, information, patient interaction, and treatment options available. 
Although chronic pain has remained difficult to treat successfully, primary care 
providers can play an integral role in delivering evidence-based and 
patient-centered care for managing chronic pain among individuals with SCI.

Chronic pain has far-reaching impacts on a person's life and on society more 
broadly. After failure or intolerance of conservative treatments, 
neuromodulation may be an option for a subgroup of patients. However, little is 
known about the patient experience of neuromodulation. We conducted a systematic 
review of published qualitative research on patient experience with 
neuromodulation for chronic pain. Four databases were searched: MEDLINE, EMBASE, 
Psych INFO, and all EMB reviews, from inception to December 4, 2019. We used 
narrative synthesis to identify key findings from the included studies. The data 
were qualitatively analyzed using a modified constant comparative analysis to 
identify key themes across the studies. Seven thousand five hundred forty-two 
unique citations were retrieved. Sixty-four abstracts were selected by the 
reviewers and continued to full-text review. After full-text review, 57 studies 
were excluded with 7 studies included in this systematic review. The included 
studies were of high quality. Four broad themes emerged: (1) living with chronic 
pain, (2) expectations, (3) managing challenges, and (4) regaining normalcy. 
Neuromodulation should be part of an overall pain management plan that may 
include the need for ongoing emotional and psychosocial support. A deeper 
knowledge of the patient experience with neuromodulation will assist care teams 
in providing meaningful support to patients. The results of this study suggest 
that further research is needed to support neuromodulation as an option for 
patients living with chronic pain.

A variety of barriers ensures the protection of the peripheral nervous system 
from noxious blood-borne or surrounding stimuli. In this review, anatomy and 
functioning of the blood nerve barrier (BNB) and the blood DRG barrier (BDB) 
will be presented and key tight junction proteins described: ZO-1, claudin-1, 
-3, -5, -11, -12, -19, occludin, and tricellulin. Different diseases can lead to 
or be accompanied by nerve barrier disruption; impairment of nerve barriers in 
turn worsens pathology. Peripheral nerve injury, diabetic neuropathy and 
inflammatory polyneuropathy cause an increased permeability of BNB and BDB. 
Knowledge and understanding of these mechanisms might ultimately lead to the 
invention of drugs to control barrier function and help ameliorating 
neurological diseases.

OBJECTIVE: The use of multicolumn-lead spinal cord stimulation (SCS) to control 
back pain (BP) and leg pain (LP) in patients with failed back surgery syndrome 
(FBSS) in the short term and mid-term has been well documented. Our study 
investigated whether SCS remained efficient after 72 months.
METHODS: In an observational, single-center study, we assessed SCS efficacy in 
62 patients with FBSS patients. BP, LP, and magnitude of daily activity 
limitation (DAL) were graded using a 0-10 visual analog scale (VAS) 
preoperatively and at 2, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 72 months after SCS implantation. 
Sleep quality, use of medications, and complications were also recorded.
RESULTS: Of the 62 patients, 15 with complete follow-up data available were 
still using their SCS device at 72 months (SCS+). For these patients, the VAS 
scores for BP, LP, and DAL had changed from a median of 9 (interquartile range 
[IQR], 8.5-10), 7 (IQR, 6-8), and 8 (IQR, 8-9) preoperatively to a median of 4 
(IQR, 3-4.5), 3 (IQR, 1.5-3.5), and 3 (IQR, 2-4) at 72 months. Their quality of 
sleep and analgesic medication consumption had also improved. In a subset of 
patients no longer using the SCS device after 72 months (SCS-), the VAS scores 
for BP, LP, and DAL, quality of sleep, and medication consumption were 
comparable to those for the SCS+ group. The SCS- group was less satisfied with 
the technique and were less professionally active than were the SCS+ group.
CONCLUSIONS: The SCS device provides sustained beneficial effects on BP, LP, 
DAL, sleep, and medication consumption in patients with FBSS still using it at 
72 months postoperatively. Further studies are needed to identify the factors of 
adherence to the technique and the chances of success compared with the natural 
evolution of FBSS.

INTRODUCTION: Dorsal root ganglion (DRG) stimulation has been established as a 
therapy in the treatment of chronic pain. Ideal electrode placement is guided by 
proper identification of the location of the DRG. The location of the S1 DRG is 
not well delineated and can be variable making ideal location of the electrode 
placement difficult based on fluoroscopic imaging.
METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of postoperative programming of S1 DRG 
leading across two centers. There were 34 lead placements in 24 patients 
included in this study. Programming parameters and contacts used were evaluated 
based on the position of the electrode in reference to the sacral border.
RESULTS: The majority of the patient programming parameters were recorded at six 
weeks following the implant. Most commonly, the programming used a simple 
continuous bipole configuration. Of the 34 leads programmed, 17 (50%) had 
programming on the sacral border, 14 (41%) were considered posterior, and 3 (9%) 
were anterior to the sacral border.
CONCLUSION: This analysis of S1 DRG programming demonstrates that ideal 
positioning of the majority of the contacts for the electrode should be 
posterior and along the sacral border on fluoroscopic imaging. These findings 
also suggest that the S1 DRG may be located most reproducibly at the border of 
the intraforaminal and intracanalicular region.

OBJECTIVE: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is one of the 
intractable long-term side effects of anticancer medications and results in pain 
and dysesthesia. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the 
primary motor cortex has been demonstrated to provide effective relief for 
intractable neuropathic pain. The objective of this study was to investigate the 
effects of rTMS treatment on CIPN in cancer patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven female patients with breast cancer or gynecologic 
cancer (mean age 64.8 [standard deviation 7.8]) who had neuropathic pain and/or 
peripheral sensory neuropathy, with a minimum two grade severity based on the 
scale of the National Cancer Institutes' Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (version 4.0) were enrolled. Patients received rTMS (5-Hz; 500 
pulses/session; figure-8 coil) on their primary motor cortex corresponding to 
the target extremity. The intensity of pain and dysesthesia for all extremities 
was evaluated using a visual analog scale for pain, dysesthesia, and the 
Japanese version of the short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire 2 (SFMPQ2).
RESULTS: rTMS for target extremity significantly decreased the visual analog 
scale of pain and dysesthesia. The intensity of pain measured by the SFMPQ2 was 
also decreased in the target extremity. Regarding non-target extremities, only 
dysesthesia significantly decreased as a result of rTMS. No adverse events were 
observed.
CONCLUSION: This is an initial report demonstrating the potential of rTMS for 
the treatment of CIPN. We suggest rTMS could be potentially beneficial and 
effective as a treatment for pain and dysesthesia in patients with CIPN.

OBJECTIVES: Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has been used to manage pain in 
patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP). The aim of this systematic review was 
to summarize the effectiveness and complications of SCS in the management of 
pain associated with CP.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: An exploratory systematic review was performed through a 
literature search of the PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, SCOPUS, and Cochrane 
databases.
RESULTS: Seven studies including 31 patients met the inclusion criteria. There 
was one observational cohort study, two case series, and four case reports. The 
estimated median age of the study group was 44 years (range 21-87 years) in 
primarily nonalcoholic CP (74%, 23/31). The SCS leads were typically placed at 
the level of T6-T8 in the epidural space. All patients reported an improvement 
in pain. The estimated median reduction of visual analogue pain scores was 61% 
(range 50%-100%) with an estimated median reduction of morphine equivalent 
opioid use of 69% (range 25%-100%) at the end of follow-up (less than one to 
greater than two years). Infection at the site of the lead occurred in 2 of the 
31 (6%) and lead migration in 2 of the 31 (6%) patients.
CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review suggests that SCS has a potentially 
efficacious role in reducing pain and opioid use in patients with CP.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to examine the effectiveness of noninvasive 
brain stimulation on neuropathic pain in individuals with spinal cord injury.
METHODS: A meta-analysis on pain intensity, depression, and anxiety levels was 
conducted to evaluate the effect of noninvasive brain stimulation on neuropathic 
pain in individuals with spinal cord injury. The authors searched Cochrane 
Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase 
(OvidSP), PsycINFO (OvidSP), and Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro). 
Randomized controlled trials comparing noninvasive brain stimulation with sham 
stimulation were included.
RESULTS: Eleven studies were selected. The pooled analysis demonstrated no 
significant effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcranial 
direct current stimulation, or cranial electrotherapy stimulation on neuropathic 
pain reduction after spinal cord injury. In addition, noninvasive brain 
stimulation showed no beneficial effect over sham stimulation on the improvement 
of depression, while it yielded a significant reduction of anxiety levels 
immediately after treatment. Subgroup analysis showed that only cranial 
electrotherapy stimulation had a significant effect on the reduction of anxiety 
levels among the three types of noninvasive brain stimulation.
CONCLUSIONS: In individuals with spinal cord injury, no significant effects of 
noninvasive brain stimulation on neuropathic pain and depression were observed. 
Cranial electrotherapy stimulation may be beneficial for the management of 
anxiety. These findings do not support the routine use of noninvasive brain 
stimulation for neuropathic pain in individuals with spinal cord injury.

Oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy is characterized by an acute 
hyperexcitability syndrome triggered/exacerbated by cold. The mechanisms 
underlying oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy are unclear, but the 
alteration of ion channel expression and activity plays a well-recognized 
central role. Recently, we found that oxaliplatin leads to cytosolic 
acidification in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Here, we investigated the 
early impact of oxaliplatin on the proton-sensitive TREK potassium channels. 
Following a 6-h oxaliplatin treatment, both channels underwent a transcription 
upregulation that returned to control levels after 42 h. The overexpression of 
TREK channels was also observed after in vivo treatment in DRG cells from mice 
exposed to acute treatment with oxaliplatin. Moreover, both intracellular pH and 
TREK channel transcription were similarly regulated after incubation with 
amiloride, an inhibitor of the Na+/H+ exchanger. In addition, we studied the 
role of oxaliplatin-induced acidification on channel behavior, and, as expected, 
we observed a robust positive modulation of TREK channel activity. Finally, we 
focused on the impact of this complex modulation on capsaicin-evoked neuronal 
activity finding a transient decrease in the average firing rate following 6 h 
of oxaliplatin treatment. In conclusion, the early activation of TREK genes may 
represent a mechanism of protection against the oxaliplatin-related perturbation 
of neuronal excitability.

INTRODUCTION: Disruptions of lumbar intervertebral discs may lead to severe 
discogenic low back pain (LBP). Severe pain has a deleterious effect on physical 
function and quality of life. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a robust 
treatment for many neuropathic pain conditions. New innovations may be 
well-suited to treat neuropathic chronic LBP, including discogenic pain. The aim 
of this prospective study was to determine the effect of dorsal root ganglion 
(DRG) stimulation for a well-selected group of patients with discogenic LBP with 
no history of previous back surgeries.
METHODS: Twenty subjects with confirmed discogenic LBP and no prior history of 
back surgery underwent trials of DRG stimulation and, if successful with at 
least 50% pain reduction, were permanently implanted. Subjects rated their pain, 
disability, quality of life, and mood at baseline, and 14 subjects were followed 
through 12 months of treatment.
RESULTS: Treatment with DRG stimulation reduced LBP ratings (68.3% reduction), 
from mean 7.20 ± 1.3 at baseline to 2.29 ± 2.1 after 12 months (p = < 0.001). 
Oswestry ratings of disability significantly decreased (p = < 0.001) from 42.09 
± 12.9 at baseline to 21.54 ± 16.4 after six months of treatment and to 20.1 ± 
16.6 after 12 months. The average quality of life EQ-5D index score at baseline 
was 0.61 ± 0.12 and 0.84 ± 0.13 after 12 months.
DISCUSSION: DRG stimulation treatment for discogenic LBP improved the level of 
pain, function, and quality of life. Further research is necessary into efficacy 
of DRG stimulation in patients with chronic discogenic LBP and to determine the 
place of SCS in the treatment algorithm.

Spinal cord stimulation at 10 kHz is a promising therapy for non-surgical 
refractory back pain; however, published data are currently limited. We present 
a subanalysis of prospectively collected clinical outcome data for non-surgical 
refractory back pain patients treated with 10 kHz spinal cord stimulation, from 
the independent cohorts of two previous studies (SENZA-RCT and SENZA-EU). 
Clinical outcomes were evaluated at pre-implantation (baseline), 3 months, 
6 months and 12 months following 10 kHz spinal cord stimulator implantation. 
These included: pain relief; responder rate (≥ 50% pain relief from baseline); 
remission rate (VAS ≤ 3.0 cm); disability (Oswestry Disability Index(ODI)); and 
opioid use. At 3 months, average back pain decreased by 70% in the combined 
cohort (60% in the SENZA-RCT and 78% in the SENZA-EU cohorts). This was 
sustained at 12 months, with a 73% back pain responder rate and 68% remission 
rate in the combined cohort. Leg pain relief results were generally comparable 
to those for back pain relief. At 12 months, the combined cohort had an average 
decrease in ODI scores of 15.7% points from baseline and opioid use more than 
halved. In conclusion, 10 kHz spinal cord stimulation reduced pain, disability 
and opioid consumption in non-surgical refractory back pain subjects. 
Application of this therapy may improve the care of non-surgical refractory back 
pain patients and reduce their opioid consumption.

OBJECTIVES: Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) for pain is typically implemented in 
an open-loop manner using parameters that remain largely unchanged. To improve 
the overall efficacy and consistency of SCS, one closed-loop approach proposes 
to use evoked compound action potentials (ECAPs) recorded from the SCS lead(s) 
as a feedback control signal to guide parameter selection. The goal of this 
study was to use a computational modeling approach to investigate the source of 
these ECAP recordings and technical and physiological factors that affect their 
composition.
METHODS: We developed a computational model that coupled a finite element model 
of lower thoracic SCS with multicompartment models of sensory axons within the 
spinal cord. We used a reciprocity-based approach to calculate SCS-induced ECAPs 
recorded from the SCS lead.
RESULTS: Our model ECAPs contained a triphasic, P1, N1, P2 morphology. The model 
P2-N1 amplitudes and conduction velocities agreed with previous experimental 
data from human subjects. Model results suggested that the ECAPs are dominated 
by the activation of axons with diameters 8.7-10.0 μm located in the dorsal 
aspect of the spinal cord. We also observed changes in the ECAP amplitude and 
shape due to the electrode location relative to the vertebrae and spinal cord.
CONCLUSION: Our modeling results suggest that clinically effective SCS relies on 
the activation of numerous axons within a narrow fiber diameter range and that 
several factors affect the composition of the ECAP recordings. These results can 
improve how we interpret and implement these recordings in a potential 
closed-loop approach to SCS.

Thalamocortical dysrhythmia is a key pathology of chronic neuropathic pain, but 
few studies have investigated thalamocortical networks in chronic low back pain 
(cLBP) given its non-specific etiology and complexity. Using fMRI, we propose an 
analytical pipeline to identify abnormal thalamocortical network dynamics in 
cLBP patients and validate the findings in two independent cohorts. We first 
identify two reoccurring dynamic connectivity states and their associations with 
chronic and temporary pain. Further analyses show that cLBP patients have 
abnormal connectivity between the ventral lateral/posterolateral nucleus 
(VL/VPL) and postcentral gyrus (PoCG) and between the dorsal/ventral medial 
nucleus and insula in the less frequent connectivity state, and temporary pain 
exacerbation alters connectivity between the VL/VPL and PoCG and the default 
mode network in the more frequent connectivity state. These results extend 
current findings on thalamocortical dysfunction and dysrhythmia in chronic pain 
and demonstrate that cLBP pathophysiology and clinical pain intensity are 
associated with distinct thalamocortical network dynamics.

Research using a categorical-polythetic classification system for mental illness 
has raised concern regarding the validity of categorical classification systems. 
Recent efforts suggest psychopathology is better understood from a dimensional 
framework, though there has been varying evidence of a somatization factor. The 
current investigation seeks to produce and validate a dimensional model of 
psychopathology, with a particular emphasis on the placement of somatization, 
across three nonoverlapping medical samples. Using a bariatric surgery seeking 
sample (n = 1,268), a spine surgery/spinal cord stimulator seeking sample (n = 
1,711), and a chronic pain treatment seeking sample (n = 1,388), a dimensional 
model of psychopathology was replicated across all three samples using a 
dimensional measure of psychopathology (the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality 
Inventory-2-Restructured Form [MMPI-2-RF]). Clear evidence of a separate 
somatization factor was found in addition to broad internalizing, externalizing, 
and social detachment factors. Constructs assessable with the model yielded good 
convergent and discriminant validity coefficients with external criteria, and 
further supported the presence of a higher-order somatization construct.

Chronic pain caused by spinal cord injury (SCI) is notoriously resistant to 
treatment, particularly by opioids. After SCI, DRG neurons show hyperactivity 
and chronic depolarization of resting membrane potential (RMP) that is 
maintained by cAMP signaling through PKA and EPAC. Importantly, SCI also reduces 
the negative regulation by Gαi of adenylyl cyclase and its production of cAMP, 
independent of alterations in G protein-coupled receptors and/or G proteins. 
Opioid reduction of pain depends on coupling of opioid receptors to Gαi/o family 
members. Combining high-content imaging and cluster analysis, we show that in 
male rats SCI decreases opioid responsiveness in vitro within a specific subset 
of small-diameter nociceptors that bind isolectin B4. This SCI effect is 
mimicked in nociceptors from naive animals by a modest 5 min depolarization of 
RMP (15 mm K+; -45 mV), reducing inhibition of cAMP signaling by μ-opioid 
receptor agonists DAMGO and morphine. Disinhibition and activation of C-Raf by 
depolarization-dependent phosphorylation are central to these effects. 
Expression of an activated C-Raf reduces sensitivity of adenylyl cyclase to 
opioids in nonexcitable HEK293 cells, whereas inhibition of C-Raf or treatment 
with the hyperpolarizing drug retigabine restores opioid responsiveness and 
blocks spontaneous activity of nociceptors after SCI. Inhibition of ERK 
downstream of C-Raf also blocks SCI-induced hyperexcitability and 
depolarization, without direct effects on opioid responsiveness. Thus, 
depolarization-dependent C-Raf and downstream ERK activity maintain a 
depolarized RMP and nociceptor hyperactivity after SCI, providing a 
self-reinforcing mechanism to persistently promote nociceptor hyperexcitability 
and limit the therapeutic effectiveness of opioids.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT 
Chronic pain induced by spinal cord injury (SCI) is often permanent and 
debilitating, and usually refractory to treatment with analgesics, including 
opioids. SCI-induced pain in a rat model has been shown to depend on persistent 
hyperactivity in primary nociceptors (injury-detecting sensory neurons), 
associated with a decrease in the sensitivity of adenylyl cyclase production of 
cAMP to inhibitory Gαi proteins in DRGs. This study shows that SCI and one 
consequence of SCI (chronic depolarization of resting membrane potential) 
decrease sensitivity to opioid-mediated inhibition of cAMP and promote 
hyperactivity of nociceptors by enhancing C-Raf activity. ERK activation 
downstream of C-Raf is necessary for maintaining ongoing depolarization and 
hyperactivity, demonstrating an unexpected positive feedback loop to 
persistently promote pain.

BACKGROUND: We aimed to evaluate the effect of bipolar pulsed radiofrequency 
(PRF) in patients with chronic cervical radicular pain who were refractory to 
monopolar PRF and transforaminal epidural steroid injection (TFESI).
METHODS: Twenty patients with chronic cervical radicular pain who were 
unresponsive to monopolar PRF and TFESI were included and underwent bipolar PRF 
of their cervical dorsal root ganglion (DRG). Treatment outcomes were evaluated 
using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) for cervical radicular pain before 
treatment and 1, 2, and 3 months post-treatment. Successful pain relief was 
defined as ≥50% reduction in the NRS score compared with the score prior to 
treatment. Furthermore, at 3 months post-treatment, patient satisfaction levels 
were evaluated; those with very good (score =7) or good (score =6) results were 
considered to be satisfied with the bipolar PRF procedure.
RESULTS: Cervical radicular pain was significantly reduced at 1, 2, and 3 months 
post-PRF (P<0.001). In addition, at 3 months post-PRF, half of the patients 
achieved a successful response and were satisfied with the treatment results.
CONCLUSIONS: Bipolar PRF on cervical DRG may be a good treatment option for 
managing refractory chronic cervical radicular pain.

BACKGROUND: Lumbar radicular pain (LRP) results from inflammation and irritation 
of lumbar spinal nerves and the dorsal root ganglion (DRG).
METHODS: Our study is a prospective, triple-blind, randomized, activecontrol 
trial (CTRI/2016/02/006666) comparing transforaminal epidural local anesthetic 
(LA) injection and pulsed radiofrequency treatment of DRG in patients with 
chronic LRP. Patients with LRP after failed conservative management for 
>3 months received selective diagnostic nerve root block with 1 mL 2% lidocaine. 
Fifty patients showing positive responses were divided into groups of 25 each. 
The LA group received transforaminal epidural injection of 1 mL 0.5% 
bupivacaine. The lumbar pulsed radiofrequency (LPRF) group received 
transforaminal epidural injection of 1 mL 0.5% bupivacaine with 3 cycles of 
pulsed radiofrequency of the DRG for 180 seconds RESULTS: Both groups were 
compared by observing pain intensity on a 0- to 100-point VAS and improvement in 
functional status by the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI version 2.0) at 2 weeks 
and 1, 2, 3, and 6 months. All baseline variables were comparable between the 2 
groups. Statistically significant reduction in both outcomes was seen in the 
LPRF group compared to the LA group from 2 weeks to 6 months. One hundred 
percent of patients in the LPRF group had a ≥20- point decrease in VAS and 
significant percentage reduction in ODI at all time intervals up to 6 months, 
whereas it was seen in 80% and 28% of patients in the LA group at 3 and 
6 months, respectively. No complications were seen in any patients CONCLUSION: 
Pulsed radiofrequency of the DRG applied for longer duration results in 
long-term pain relief and improvement in the functional quality of life in 
patients with chronic LRP.

INTRODUCTION: The effectiveness of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) as 
pain-relieving treatment for failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) has already 
been demonstrated. However, potential structural and functional brain 
alterations resulting from subsensory SCS are less clear. The aim of this study 
was to test structural volumetric changes in a priori chosen regions of interest 
related to chronic pain after 1 month and 3 months of high-frequency SCS in 
patients with FBSS.
METHODS: Eleven patients with FBSS who were scheduled for SCS device 
implantation were included in this study. All patients underwent a magnetic 
resonance imaging protocol before SCS device implantation 1 and 3 months after 
high-frequency SCS. Pain intensity, pain catastrophizing, and sleep quality were 
also measured. Regions-of-interest voxel-based morphometry was used to explore 
grey matter volumetric changes over time. Additionally, volumetric changes were 
correlated with changes in pain intensity, catastrophizing, and sleep quality.
RESULTS: Significant decreases were found in volume in the left and right 
hippocampus over time. More specifically, a significant difference was revealed 
between volumes before SCS implantation and after 3 months of SCS. 
Repeated-measures correlations revealed a significant positive correlation 
between volumetric changes in the left hippocampus and changes in back pain 
score over time and between volumetric changes in the right hippocampus and 
changes in back pain score over time.
CONCLUSION: In patients with FBSS, high-frequency SCS influences structural 
brain regions over time. The volume of the hippocampus was decreased bilaterally 
after 3 months of high-frequency SCS with a positive correlation with back pain 
intensity.

BACKGROUND: Opioid misuse in the USA is an epidemic. Utilization of 
neuromodulation for refractory chronic pain may reduce opioid-related morbidity 
and mortality, and associated economic costs.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) on opioid dose 
reduction.
METHODS: The IBM MarketScan® database was retrospectively queried for all US 
patients with a chronic pain diagnosis undergoing SCS between 2010 and 2015. 
Opioid usage before and after the procedure was quantified as morphine milligram 
equivalents (MME).
RESULTS: A total of 8497 adult patients undergoing SCS were included. Within 1 
yr of the procedure, 60.4% had some reduction in their opioid use, 34.2% moved 
to a clinically important lower dosage group, and 17.0% weaned off opioids 
entirely. The proportion of patients who completely weaned off opioids increased 
with decreasing preprocedure dose, ranging from 5.1% in the >90 MME group to 
34.2% in the ≤20 MME group. The following variables were associated with reduced 
odds of weaning off opioids post procedure: long-term opioid use (odds ratio 
[OR]: 0.26; 95% CI: 0.21-0.30; P < .001), use of other pain medications (OR: 
0.75; 95% CI: 0.65-0.87; P < .001), and obesity (OR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.60-0.94; 
P = .01).
CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing SCS were able to reduce opioid usage. Given the 
potential to reduce the risks of long-term opioid therapy, this study lays the 
groundwork for efforts that may ultimately push stakeholders to reduce payment 
and policy barriers to SCS as part of an evidence-based, patient-centered 
approach to nonopioid solutions for chronic pain.

OBJECTIVES: Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has gained traction as an alternative 
to chronic opioid therapy in light of the opioid crisis. Prior reports vary 
widely in their estimates of its effect on opioid consumption. We therefore 
aimed to address the following questions: 1) Does chronic opioid use change 
after SCS? 2) Which patient characteristics predict reduced opioid consumption 
after SCS?
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Claims from a private health insurance company were used 
to identify patients with SCS implantation from 2003 to 2014. We required 
12 months of continuous data before and after surgery (i.e., a minimum total 
observation period of two years), and at least two opioid prescription fills in 
the six months before surgery. Daily morphine equivalent dose (MED) was 
calculated from prescription medication claims. Diagnosis codes identified 
common comorbidities.
RESULTS: Hundred forty-five patients met inclusion criteria. MED of 65 was the 
most statistically meaningful preoperative dose threshold. Approximately half of 
patients decreased opioid use >20% after SCS implantation. Logistic regression 
analysis revealed age (p = 0.0362), gender (p = 0.0076), and preoperative daily 
MED < 65 (p = 0.0322) as predictors of meaningful reduction, which was defined 
as a 20% reduction in MED.
CONCLUSIONS: With only half of chronic opioid users demonstrating meaningful 
opioid reduction after SCS implantation, we demonstrate that current SCS 
technology does not reliably help a larger number of patients reduce opioid 
usage. Women, older age, and preoperative MED < 65 are predictive of meaningful 
opioid reduction but only one of these is modifiable. As not all patients saw 
benefit from their therapies, there is still much room for improvement in the 
treatment of refractory chronic pain that is associated with failed back surgery 
syndrome and chronic regional pain syndrome.

BACKGROUND: Dry-electrode-based transcranial direct current stimulation is a new 
type of non-invasive brain stimulation system which relieves chronic low back 
pain and improves related muscle movement, in a way that overcomes the drawback 
of conventional systems.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness of dry-electrode-based transcranial 
direct current stimulation in relieving chronic low back pain and altering 
pain-related low back muscles movement, by using pain assessment tool and 
surface electromyographic topography.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective, double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled 
study. 60 patients with non-specific chronic low back pain were randomly and 
evenly allocated into tDCS and sham groups. Each group accepted a single 
20-minute stimulation at 2 mA on the primary motor cortex. Numeric rating scale 
for pain intensity assessment and root-mean-square difference parameter from 
surface electromyographic topography were measured before and after stimulation. 
The current direction in brain using finite element method was simulated to 
verify the current distribution under dry stimulation electrode.
RESULTS: After stimulation, the pain intensity in the tDCS group significantly 
decreased, while it did not show evident change in the sham group. However, 
change of root-mean-square difference parameters between tDCS and sham groups 
showed no significant difference. Simulation results based on finite element 
method showed most of current focused on primary motor cortex while peak value 
of current density was 0.225 A/m2.
CONCLUSIONS: Dry-electrode-based transcranial direct current stimulation can 
lower pain perception in patients with chronic low back pain. The analgesic 
mechanism can affect the top-down modulation pathway of pain.

INTRODUCTION: Chronic neuropathic low back pain (CNLBP) is a debilitating 
condition in which established medical treatments seldom alleviate symptoms. 
Evidence demonstrates that high-frequency 10 kHz spinal cord stimulation (SCS) 
reduces pain and improves health-related quality of life in patients with failed 
back surgery syndrome (FBSS), but evidence of this effect is limited in 
individuals with CNLBP who have not had surgery. The aim of this multicentre 
randomised trial is to assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of 10 kHz SCS 
for this population.
METHODS: This is a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, sham-controlled trial 
with a parallel economic evaluation. A total of 96 patients with CNLBP who have 
not had spinal surgery will be implanted with an epidural lead and a sham lead 
outside the epidural space without a screening trial. Patients will be 
randomised 1:1 to 10 kHz SCS plus usual care (intervention group) or to sham 
10 kHz SCS plus usual care (control group) after receiving the full implant. The 
SCS devices will be programmed identically using a cathodal cascade. 
Participants will use their handheld programmer to alter the intensity of the 
stimulation as per routine practice. The primary outcome will be a 7-day daily 
pain diary. Secondary outcomes include the Oswestry Disability Index, 
complications, EQ-5D-5 L, and health and social care costs. Outcomes will be 
assessed at baseline (pre-randomisation) and at 1 month, 3 months and 6 months 
after device activation. The primary analyses will compare primary and secondary 
outcomes between groups at 6 months, while adjusting for baseline outcome 
scores. Incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) will be 
calculated at 6 months and over the lifetime of the patient.
DISCUSSION: The outcomes of this trial will inform clinical practice and 
healthcare policy on the role of high-frequency 10 kHz SCS for use in patients 
with CNLBP who have not had surgery.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The treatment of deafferentation pain by spinal 
DREZotomy is a proven therapeutic option in the literature. In recent years, use 
of DREZotomy has been relegated to second place due to the emergence of 
neuromodulation therapies. The objectives of this study are to demonstrate that 
DREZotomy continues to be an effective and safe treatment and to analyse 
predictive factors for success.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted of all patients 
treated in our department with spinal DREZotomy from 1998 to 2018. Bulbar 
DREZotomy procedures were excluded. A visual analogue scale (VAS) and the 
reduction of routine medication were used as outcome variables. Demographic, 
clinical and operative variables were analysed as predictive factors for 
success.
RESULTS: A total of 27 patients (51.9% female) with a mean age of 53.7 years 
underwent DREZotomy. The main cause of pain was brachial plexus injury (BPI) 
(55.6%) followed by neoplasms (18.5%). The mean time of pain evolution was 8.4 
years with a mean intensity of 8.7 according to the VAS, even though 63% of the 
patients had previously received neurostimulation therapy. Favourable outcome 
(≥50% pain reduction in the VAS) was observed in 77.8% of patients during the 
postoperative period and remained in 59.3% of patients after 22 months average 
follow-up (mean reduction of 4.9 points). This allowed for a reduction in 
routine analgesic treatment in 70.4% of them. DREZotomy in BPI-related pain 
presented a significantly higher success rate (93%) than the other pathologies 
(41.7%) (p=.001). No association was observed between outcome and age, gender, 
DREZ technique, duration of pain or previous neurostimulation therapies. There 
were six neurological complications, four post-operative transient neurological 
deficits and two permanent deficits.
CONCLUSION: Dorsal root entry zone surgery is effective and safe for treating 
patients with deafferentation pain, especially after brachial plexus injury. It 
can be considered an alternative treatment after failed neurostimulation 
techniques for pain control. However, its indication should be considered as the 
first therapeutic option after medical therapy failure due to its good long-term 
results.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a 
multifaceted disorder resulting in an abnormal pain response to tissue injury. 
Among key CRPS features are neurogenic inflammation, maladaptive plasticity, and 
vasomotor dysfunction, which can result in severe pain and disability. Spinal 
cord stimulation (SCS) is an efficacious treatment for several chronic pain 
conditions and may improve pain and life quality in CRPS patients with CRPS. 
However, little information exists regarding perioperative outcomes of patients 
with CRPS undergoing surgical implantation of an SCS device.
METHODS: Patients were included if they underwent an SCS procedure at our 
institution between 2008 and 2016 for chronic pain. Cases were excluded if the 
procedure involved stimulator removal or if it was an outpatient procedure. 
Multivariate regression assessed the effect of CRPS and other clinical variables 
on perioperative outcomes.
RESULTS: Eighty-one inpatient SCS implantation cases for chronic pain were 
included, with 9 patients (11.1%) having a CRPS diagnosis. The CRPS cohort 
received higher mean quantities of intraoperative opioids and had a lower 
proportion of patients reporting meaningful pain reduction (16.7%) in the 
24-hour postoperative setting compared with patients without CRPS (35.9%), 
although this was not statistically significant. Multivariate regression 
modeling suggested that CRPS was a significant predictor of increased odds of 
extended time to the postanesthesia care unit discharge (P = 0.0406) and higher 
direct costs of hospitalization (P = 0.0326).
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that CRPS may pose several unique risks in the 
perioperative period after inpatient SCS implantation. These findings support 
the need for future prospective investigations examining risks and outcomes for 
SCS procedures in this population.

Diabetes is a global epidemic and more than 50% diabetic patients are also 
diagnosed with neuropathy, which greatly affects the quality of life of the 
patients. Available treatments are not always successful due to the limited 
efficacy and complications, such as addiction and dependency. Studies have 
implicated that high mobility group box1 (HMGB1) protein plays a crucial role in 
neuroinflammation and the development of neuropathic conditions. HMGB1 is a 
proinflammatory cytokine that can be released from necrotic cells in passive 
form or in response to inflammatory signals as an active form. HMGB1 is the 
ligand for the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), and 
toll-like receptors, (TLR)-2 and TLR4, which also indirectly activates C-X-C 
chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4). We investigated whether blocking of HMGB1 can 
reduce pain and inflammation in diabetic neuropathic animals to further 
understand the role of HMGB1 in diabetic neuropathy. Type 2 diabetic rats and 
mice were treated with natural inhibitor of HMGB1, glycyrrhizin (GLC) for five 
days/week for four weeks at a dose of 50 mg/kg per day by intraperitoneal 
injection. The animals were divided into three categories: naïve control, 
diabetic alone, diabetic with GLC treatment. All of the behavioral analyses were 
conducted before and after the treatment. The expression of inflammatory markers 
and changes in histone acetylation in the peripheral nervous system were 
measured by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis after the completion 
of the treatment. Our study revealed that TLR4, HMGB1, CXCR4, and Nod-like 
receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) levels were increased in the spinal and dorsal root 
ganglia (DRG) neurons of Type 2 diabetic mice and rats with painful neuropathy. 
GLC treatment inhibited the increases in TLR4, NLRP3, and CXCR4 expressions and 
improved the mechanical and thermal pain threshold in these animals. 
Immunohistochemical studies revealed that hyperglycemia mediated inflammation 
influenced HMGB1 acetylation and its release from the neurons. It also altered 
histone 3 acetylation in the microglial cells. The inhibition of HMGB1 by GLC 
prevented the release of HMGB1 as well as H3K9 acetylation. These findings 
indicate that the interruption of HMGB1 mediated inflammation could ameliorate 
diabetic neuropathy and might exhibit a unique target for the treatment.

BACKGROUND: Given the range of subjective experiences reported by patients with 
chronic pain, Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) systems designed for tailored 
delivery of analgesic therapy may help improve treatment effectiveness and 
satisfaction.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This case-series evaluated 420 patients with 
chronic back and/or leg pain implanted with an SCS device capable of sequential 
or simultaneous delivery of neurostimulation (i.e. combination therapy) as well 
as multiple waveforms and/or field shapes. Following implantation, an array of 
standard programs (e.g. paresthesia-based SCS), and a custom set of 
sub-perception programs were provided per patient feedback. Pain scores (Numeric 
Rating Scale, NRS) were collected at baseline and during follow-up.
RESULTS: In this multicenter, observational series (n = 420, 53.1% female; Age: 
64.2 ± 13.4 years), a mean overall pain score of 7.2 ± 1.8 (SD) was reported 
pre-trial (Baseline). At a mean follow-up duration of 208 ± 200 (SD) days, the 
mean overall pain score reduced to 2.4 (p < 0.0001). Overall pain was reduced by 
5.1 ± 2.4 and 4.5 ± 2.4 points (NRS) at 3-months (N = 256) and at 12-months

CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that highly 'customizable' SCS approaches may 
allow for highly effective pain relief within the real-world clinical setting.

BACKGROUND: Therapeutic approaches to spinal cord stimulation (SCS) continue to 
evolve and improve patient outcomes in patients receiving SCS therapy secondary 
to failed back surgery syndrome.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate pain relief and other patient 
outcomes of SCS using selected high-dose programming parameters.
STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective cohort study.
SETTING: This study took place at 11 centers in North America.
METHODS: Forty-four SCS-naive patients underwent trialing, starting with 1,000 
Hz frequency, 90 µs pulse width followed by 300 Hz frequency, 800 µs pulse 
width, if pain relief was inadequate. Patients with 50% or greater pain relief 
were eligible for permanent implantation. Patient's pain rating, global 
impression of change, health-related quality of life, functional disability, 
satisfaction/recommendation, stimulation perception, device programming, and 
adverse events were assessed at 3 months postimplant.
RESULTS: There were significant improvements from baseline in mean Numeric 
Rating Scale (NRS-11) pain scores for overall pain (7.5 to 3.8; P < 0.01), back 
pain (7.2 to 3.4; P < 0.01), leg pain (7.2 to 3.1; P < 0.01), Oswestry 
Disability Index (ODI) score (51.5 to 32.1; P < 0.01), and European Quality of 
Life-Five Dimensions, version 5L score (EQ-5D-5L) (0.58 to 0.74; P < 0.01). 
Twenty-eight of 32 patients (88%) had significant, favorable improvement in 
Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC). Eighty-four percent of patients were 
"satisfied," and 78.1% would "definitely" recommend SCS. Eighteen patients (56%) 
used 1,000 Hz frequency and 90 µs pulse width exclusively; these patients 
experienced mean NRS-11 overall pain score improvement of 4.7 points. Device-, 
therapy-, or procedure-related adverse events were experienced in 19 patients 
(40%, 19 of 48), and all events resolved without reoperation and were similar to 
those observed with traditional SCS systems.
LIMITATIONS: There was no active or sham comparator group, and therefore the 
reported effects may not be solely attributable to therapy effects and may be 
related to other, nonspecific effects of SCS.
CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in pain relief, PGIC, EQ-5D-5L, ODI, and patient 
satisfaction were all clinically relevant and statistically significant. Future 
studies are needed to understand how these high-dose parameters perform versus a 
standard comparator.

BACKGROUND: There is a dearth in our understanding of the factors that are 
predictive of successful spinal cord stimulator (SCS) trials and eventual 
conversion to permanent implants. Knowledge of these factors is important for 
appropriate patient selection and treatment optimization.
OBJECTIVES: Although previous studies have explored factors predictive of trial 
success, few have examined the role of waveform in trial outcomes. This study 
sought to establish the relationship of neuraxial waveform and related measures 
to trial outcomes.
STUDY DESIGN: This study used a retrospective chart review design.
METHODS: Data were retrospectively collected on 174 patients undergoing SCS 
trials upon institutional review board approval of the study protocol. 
Indications for SCS were: complex regional pain syndrome, failed back surgery 
syndrome with radicular symptoms, peripheral neuropathy, and axial low back 
pain. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression analyses were used to 
assess the association of demographic and clinical variables with SCS trial 
outcomes.
RESULTS: The study population comprised 56% women, had a median age of 55 
(interquartile range [IQR], 44-64), and 32 of 174 (18%) patients failed SCS 
trials. Individuals with successful trials (>= 50% pain relief) were 
significantly younger and had a median age of 54 years (IQR, 42-60) compared to 
those who failed SCS trials (median age 66 years; IQR, 50-76; P = .005). 
Adjusting for age, gender, number of leads, pain category, and diagnoses: 
surgical history (odds ratio [OR] = 4.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-15.8) 
and paresthesia-based tonic-stimulation (OR = 10.3; 95% CI, 1.7-62.0), but not 
burst or high frequency, were significantly associated with successful trials. 
Of note, the number of leads (whether dual or single), pain duration, 
characteristics, and category (nociceptive vs neuropathic) were not significant 
factors. An interaction between surgical spine history and lower extremity pain 
was significantly associated with a positive trial (P = .005).
LIMITATIONS: This study was limited by its retrospective nature and focus on a 
patient population at a single major academic medical center.
CONCLUSIONS: Paresthesia-based tonic stimulation, age, and surgical history have 
significant effects on SCS trials. Prospective and randomized controlled studies 
may provide deeper insights regarding impact on costs and overall outcomes.IRB

OBJECTIVES: Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is considered an effective 
pain-relieving treatment for patients with Failed Back Surgery Syndrome (FBSS). 
Despite the clinical effectiveness, it is unknown whether the altered functional 
connectivity in such patients, as compared to healthy persons, can be influenced 
by SCS. Therefore, the goal of this study is to evaluate whether brain 
connectivity assessed by EEG differs between baseline and SCS in patients with 
FBSS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight patients with FBSS underwent a resting-state EEG 
protocol before SCS, 1.5 months and 2.5 months after receiving SCS. At each 
frequency band, power spectrums were compared for no SCS, conventional (CON) SCS 
and High Dose (HD) SCS. Functional connectivity, with the aid of eConnectome was 
also calculated.
RESULTS: Significant differences in the average power density spectrum over the 
whole scalp were observed between no SCS, CON SCS and HD SCS in delta, theta and 
beta frequency bands (p < 0.01). The average power spectrum for CON SCS was 
significantly lower than the average power spectrum for HD SCS. Marked increases 
in strength of the information flow between electrode pair FC3-TP9 in the beta 
frequency band (p = 0.006) were found in favor of HD SCS.
CONCLUSIONS: The differences in power spectrum and connectivity between the 
three conditions lead to the hypothesis that HD SCS differs from CON SCS on 
average power spectrum, suggesting that HD SCS may have a higher contribution on 
the excitatory bottom-up pathway.

Background: The use of noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) combined with 
exercise could produce synergistic effects on chronic pain conditions. This 
study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NIBS combined with exercise to 
treat chronic pain as well as to describe the parameters used to date in this 
combination.Methods: The search was carried out in Medline, Central, Scopus, 
Embase, and Pedro until November 2019. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and 
quasi-experimental studies reporting the use of noninvasive brain stimulation 
and exercise on patients with chronic pain were selected and revised.Results: 
The authors included eight studies (RCTs), reporting eight comparisons (219 
participants). Authors found a significant and homogeneous pain decrease (ES: 
-0.62, 95% CI:-0.89 to -0.34; I2 = 0.0%) in favor of the combined intervention 
compared to sham NIBS + exercise, predominantly by excitatory (anodal tDCS/rTMS) 
motor cortex stimulation. Regarding NIBS techniques, the pooled effect sizes 
were significant for both tDCS (ES: -0.59, 95% CI: -0.89 to -0.29, I2 = 0.0%) 
and rTMS (ES: -0.76, 95% CI: -1.41 to -0.11, I2 = 0.0%).Conclusions: This 
meta-analysis suggests a significant moderate to large effects of the NIBS and 
exercise combination in chronic pain. The authors discuss the potential 
theoretical framework for this synergistic effect.

BACKGROUND: Chronic neuropathic pain associated with peripheral neuropathies 
cannot be attributed solely to lesions of peripheral sensory axons and likely 
involves alteration in the processing of nociceptive information in the central 
nervous system in most patients. Few data are available regarding EEG correlates 
of chronic neuropathic pain. The fact is that effective cortical neuromodulation 
strategies to treat neuropathic pain target the precentral cortical region, i.e. 
a cortical area corresponding to the motor cortex. It is not known how these 
strategies might modulate brain rhythms in the central cortical region, but it 
can be speculated that sensorimotor rhythms (SMRs) are modified. Another potent 
way of modulating cortical rhythms is to use EEG-based neurofeedback (NFB). Rare 
studies previously aimed at relieving neuropathic pain using EEG-NFB training.
METHODS/DESIGN: The objective of this single-centre, single-blinded, randomized 
controlled pilot study is to assess the value of an EEG-NFB procedure to relieve 
chronic neuropathic pain in patients with painful peripheral neuropathy. A 
series of 32 patients will be randomly assigned to one of the two following 
EEG-NFB protocols, aimed at increasing either the low-β(SMR)/high-β ratio (n=16) 
or the α(μ)/θ ratio (n=16) at central (rolandic) cortical level. Various 
clinical outcome measures will be collected before and one week after 12 EEG-NFB 
sessions performed over 4weeks. Resting-state EEG will also be recorded 
immediately before and after each NFB session. The primary endpoint will be the 
change in the impact of pain on patient's daily functioning, as assessed on the 
Interference Scale of the short form of the Brief Pain Inventory.
DISCUSSION: The value of EEG-NFB procedures to relieve neuropathic pain has been 
rarely studied. This pilot study will attempt to show the value of endogenous 
modulation of brain rhythms in the central (rolandic) region in the frequency 
band corresponding to the frequency of stimulation currently used by therapeutic 
motor cortex stimulation. In the case of significant clinical benefit produced 
by the low-β(SMR)/high-β ratio increasing strategy, this work could pave the way 
for using EEG-NFB training within the armamentarium of neuropathic pain therapy.

INTRODUCTION: Apart from the clinical efficacy of high frequency spinal cord 
stimulation at 10 kHz, the underlying mechanism of action remains unclear. In 
parallel with spinal or segmental theories, supraspinal hypotheses have been 
recently proposed. In order to unveil hidden altered brain connectome patterns, 
a resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) protocol was 
performed in subjects routinely treated for back and/or leg pain with 
high-frequency spinal cord stimulation (HF-SCS) HF-SCS at 10 kHz.
METHODS: RsfMRI imaging was obtained from ten patients with failed back surgery 
syndrome who were eligible for HF-SCS at 10 kHz. Specifically-chosen regions of 
interest with different connectivity networks have been investigated over time. 
Baseline measurements were compared with measurements after 1 month and 3 months 
of HF-SCS at 10 kHz. Additionally, clinical parameters on pain intensity, 
central sensitization, pain catastrophizing, and sleep quality were correlated 
with the functional connectivity strengths.
RESULTS: The study results demonstrate an increased connectivity over time 
between the anterior insula (affective salience network) and regions of the 
frontoparietal network and the central executive network. After 3 months of 
HF-SCS, the increased strength in functional connectivity between the left 
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the right anterior insula was significantly 
correlated with the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) value of the 
Pittsburgh sleep quality index.
CONCLUSION: These findings support the hypothesis that HF-SCS at 10 kHz might 
influence the salience network and therefore also the emotional awareness of 
pain.

BACKGROUND: Suprascapular nerve (SSN) block is a useful tool for pain control of 
different chronic shoulder pain syndromes. If the short-term effect of nerve 
block using local anesthetics is not sufficient, pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) 
neuromodulation of the SSN may provide long-term pain relief.
AIM OF INVESTIGATION: The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness 
of ultrasonography-guided PRF of the SSN for management of chronic shoulder 
pain.
SUBJECTS AND METHOD: Thirty patients with chronic shoulder pain underwent 
diagnostic ultrasonography-guided SSN block. After confirmation of positive 
results (>50% pain relief) via diagnostic testing, PRF of the SSN was performed 
in 27 patients, followed by application of dexamethasone; however, 2 patients 
had negative results with diagnostic block and 1 patient dropped out after 
positive results with diagnostic block. Pain was recorded using the VAS, and 
active range of motion of the affected shoulder was measured by goniometry 
(flexion, extension, adduction, abduction, external rotation, internal 
rotation). Assessments were done on day 0 and after 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks.
STATISTICAL TEST: One-way analysis of variance testing.
RESULTS: The VAS score decreased significantly (P < 0.05) immediately after 
injection, and pain reduction was sustained for up to 24 weeks. Active range of 
motion in all directions also increased significantly (P < 0.5) after the 
procedure.
CONCLUSION: PRF of the SSN under ultrasonography guidance is a safe and 
effective treatment modality for management of chronic shoulder pain. The effect 
of a combination of PRF and a short-acting corticosteroid lasts up to 24 weeks, 
thereby assisting patients in undergoing relatively painless physiotherapy.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Chronic pain is commonly reported in individuals with 
spinal cord injuries (SCIs), with recent prevalence reported as high as 80%. 
Uncontrolled pain is known to decrease quality of life, attenuate mood, and 
impact sleep. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) for the treatment of refractory pain 
was first used in the SCI population in 1972. To date there have been no 
randomized controlled trials examining the effect of SCS on neuropathic pain 
post-SCI. A literature review in 2009 identified 27 studies, the majority prior 
to 2000, that included at least 1 patient with SCI. Given the significant 
advancements in the field of SCS, this review examines the updated evidence of 
SCS for the treatment of neuropathic pain in individuals with SCI and provides 
guidance on future investigations.
METHODS: MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched. All published reports, case 
series, and clinical trials reviewing SCS for neuropathic pain that included at 
least 1 individual with SCI were included.
RESULTS: The initial search identified 376 reports, of which 22 met inclusion 
criteria, for a total of 69 patients. All reports were of very low quality. A 
majority of the reported patients were male, underwent tonic stimulation, and 
reportedly experienced improvement in pain and spasticity, with decreased use of 
pain medication.
CONCLUSIONS: The synthesized findings from primarily case studies support the 
safety of SCS in SCI with the suggestion of potential pain relief benefit; 
however, data from low-quality studies are insufficient for informing clinical 
practice. A well-designed, prospective clinical trial is proposed to further 
investigate this indication.

10-kHz High-Frequency Spinal Cord Stimulation for Adults With Chronic Noncancer 
Pain: A Health Technology Assessment.

Ontario Health (Quality).

Collaborators: Pron G, McMartin K, Gajic-Veljanoski O, Xie S, Guo J, Wells D, 
Holubowich C.

BACKGROUND: Chronic pain is costly for patients and for the health care system. 
It negatively affects people's physical, emotional, social, and mental health. 
We conducted a health technology assessment of 10-kHz high-frequency spinal cord 
stimulation (SCS) in adults with chronic noncancer pain that was refractory to 
medical management, which included an evaluation of effectiveness, safety, 
cost-effectiveness, the budget impact of publicly funding 10-kHz high-frequency 
SCS, and patient preferences and values.
METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search of the clinical evidence. 
We assessed the risk of bias of each included study using the Cochrane Risk of 
Bias and ROBINS-I tools and the quality of the body of evidence according to the 
Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) 
Working Group criteria. We performed a systematic economic literature search. We 
analyzed the 5-year budget impact of publicly funding 10-kHz high-frequency SCS 
in Ontario for adults with chronic noncancer pain who had already tried other 
available SCS therapies (up to 1.2 kHz). To contextualize the potential value of 
10-kHz high-frequency SCS, we spoke with people who had chronic noncancer pain.
RESULTS: We included 5 studies (7 publications) in the clinical evidence review. 
Overall, 10-kHz high-frequency SCS likely provides reductions in pain intensity 
and functional disability, and improvements in quality of life in people with 
chronic noncancer pain (GRADE: Moderate). As well, patients may reduce their 
opioid consumption with 10-kHz high-frequency SCS (GRADE: Low). The two included 
economic evaluations found that 10-kHz high-frequency SCS was cost-saving 
compared with conventional SCS, but neither was applicable to the Ontario 
context. Owing to limited evidence about the effectiveness of 10-kHz 
high-frequency SCS in people who have first tried and failed SCS at lower 
frequencies (up to 1.2 kHz), we did not conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis 
comparing this pathway of care and 10-kHz high-frequency SCS for Ontario. 
Publicly funding 10-kHz high-frequency SCS (using the Freedom SCS system) in 
Ontario over the next 5 years would lead to a total net cost savings of $0.73 
million (ranging from about $0.10 million in year 1 to about $0.21 million in 
year 5). However, if the province outsourced this therapy using the Senza HF10 
SCS system, the total 5-year budget impact would be about $8.76 million. The 
people we spoke with who had chronic noncancer pain reported that their pain had 
a substantial negative impact on their activities and emotional well-being. 
Their direct knowledge of different pain therapies allowed them to provide 
context and comparisons when they discussed the impact of SCS on their chronic 
pain.
CONCLUSIONS: For adults with chronic noncancer pain that was refractory to 
medical management, 10-kHz high-frequency SCS was effective in relieving pain, 
reducing disability, and improving quality of life. Because there was limited 
evidence about the effectiveness of 10-kHz high-frequency SCS in people who had 
first tried and failed SCS at lower frequencies (up to 1.2 kHz), we were unable 
to determine whether 10-kHz high-frequency SCS is cost-effective in the Ontario 
context. We estimate that publicly funding 10-kHz high-frequency SCS in Ontario 
would result in cost savings of about $0.10 million to $0.21 million per year, 
for a potential total 5-year net cost savings of about $0.73 million. Although 
people with chronic noncancer pain knew little about SCS before they received 
it, they reported that it reduced their level of chronic pain, leading to 
improvements in function and their ability to perform activities of daily 
living.

INTRODUCTION: The situation generated in the health system by the COVID-19 
pandemic has provoked a crisis involving the necessity to cancel non-urgent and 
oncologic activity in the operating room and in day-to-day practice. As the 
situation continues, the need to reinstate attention for patients with chronic 
pain grows. The restoration of this activity has to begin with on-site 
appointments and possible surgical procedures. On-site clinical activity has to 
guarantee the safety of patients and health workers.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review was to evaluate how to manage activity 
in pain units, considering the scenario generated by the pandemic and the 
implications of chronic pain on the immune system and proposed pharmacological 
and interventional therapies.
METHODS: Besides the established general recommendations (physical distance, 
surgical masks, gloves, etc.), we established specific recommendations that will 
allow patient treatment and relieve the disruption of the immune response. It is 
important to highlight the use of opioids with the least influence in the immune 
system. Further, individualized corticoid use, risk assessment, reduced immune 
suppression, and dose adjustment should take patient needs into account. In this 
scenario, we highlight the use of radiofrequency and neuromodulation therapies, 
techniques that do not interfere with the immune response.
CONCLUSIONS: We describe procedures to implement these recommendations for 
individual clinical situations, the therapeutic possibilities and safety 
guidelines for each center, and government recommendations during the COVID-19 
pandemic.

Neuropathic pain is a kind of chronic pain that is triggered or caused primarily 
by damage to the nervous system and neurological dysfunction. It's known that 
dexmedetomidine is a new type of highly selective alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist 
with sedation, anti-anxiety, analgesic and other effects. However, the function 
and mechanism of dexmedetomidine on neuropathic pain are not clear. Rat DRG 
neurons were isolated and identified using immunofluorescence assay. Following 
treatment with H2O2, dexmedetomidine or ROS inhibitor (NAC), the apoptosis and 
ROS levels were examined by flow cytometery; apoptosis- and anaerobic 
glycolysis-related proteins were determined by Western blot assay; glucose 
consumption, pyruvic acid, lactic acid and ATP/ADP ratios were also measured. 
The results revealed that dexmedetomidine inhibited H2O2-induced apoptosis and 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) in rat DRG neurons and in addition, 
dexmedetomidine down-regulated the expression levels of anaerobic 
glycolysis-related proteins, significantly reduced glucose, pyruvic acid and 
lactic acid levels. It also increased the ATP/ADP ratio in H2O2-treated rat 
dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Moreover, we also demonstrated that ROS 
inhibitor (NAC) also inhibited H2O2-induced apoptosis and anaerobic glycolysis 
in rat DRG neurons. In conclusion, dexmedetomidine suppressed H2O2-induced 
apoptosis and anaerobic glycolysis activity by inhibiting ROS, in rat DRG 
neurons. Therefore, dexmedetomidine might play a pivotal role in neuropathic 
pain by the inhibition of ROS.

BACKGROUND: High-frequency 10-kHz spinal cord stimulation (10-kHz SCS) has shown 
promise in multicenter prospective trials for the management of chronic back and 
leg pain. Traditional spinal cord stimulation (t-SCS) has a long history of 
effectiveness in chronic neuropathic syndromes but not uncommonly can fail to 
provide long-term relief, leaving a significant group of patients with 
unsatisfactory outcomes. There is mounting evidence that 10-kHz SCS may offer 
relief in this subset of patients.
METHODS: The purpose of this retrospective analysis was to report a 
single-institution long-term experience of 10-kHz SCS in patients who did not 
get adequate pain relief with prior t-SCS devices. A temporary trial of 10-kHz 
SCS was carried out for 7 days, and those experiencing an average of 50% 
reduction in pain intensity underwent implantation. Patients were classified as 
moderate responders if relief was 31% to 50% and excellent responders if pain 
relief exceeded 50%.
RESULTS: Thirty-one patients who had experienced failed t-SCS primarily from 
poor paresthesia coverage underwent a trial of 10-kHz SCS and 29 underwent 
implantation. Twenty-eight patients were available for analysis, with 57.1% 
experiencing 30% response and 46.4% experiencing excellent response at a median 
follow-up of 21.2 (±8.4) months.
CONCLUSIONS: This small single-institution study suggests that a significant 
proportion of patients with previously failed t-SCS may achieve clinically 
meaningful and durable pain relief with 10-kHz SCS.

OBJECTIVE: Burst spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a novel stimulation paradigm 
that seems to provide better pain relief compared to the classic tonic SCS with 
minimal paresthesia sensation. Based on source localized electroencephalography 
and clinical data, it has been proposed that burst stimulation as defined by 
Dirk De Ridder exerts this greater effect by not only modulating the lateral and 
the descending pain-inhibitory pathways (similar to tonic SCS) but also 
modulating the medial pain pathway, which encodes the affective, motivational 
aspects of pain.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The current study evaluates the supraspinal differences 
between burst and tonic stimulation with another functional imaging technique, 
namely fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FGD-PET) scanning, in 
seven patients, who underwent both burst and tonic SCS, to confirm this notion 
of medial pain pathway modulation.
RESULTS: The results of the current FGD-PET study show that burst stimulation, 
in contrast to tonic stimulation, indeed modulates the dorsal anterior cingulate 
cortex (i.e., medial pain pathway) more than tonic stimulation.
DISCUSSION: Our data suggest an inherent difference in the central neural 
mechanisms during burst and tonic stimulation, which could potentially alter the 
patient's perception of pain.

BACKGROUND: Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a neuromodulatory technique used to 
relieve chronic pain. Previous instances of malicious remote control of 
implantable medical devices, including insulin delivery pumps and implantable 
cardiac defibrillators, have been documented. Though no cases of neuromodulatory 
hacking have been recorded outside of the academic setting, an understanding of 
SCS technology and the possible consequences of manipulation is important in 
promoting safety.
METHODS: We review the components and implantation protocol of a SCS system, the 
functionality and technological specifications for SCS systems in the global 
market based on their device manuals, and patient- and clinician-specific 
adjustable factors. Furthermore, we assess documented instances of implantable 
medical device hacking and speculate on the potential harms of targeting SCS 
systems.
RESULTS: SCS systems from Abbott Laboratories, Boston Scientific, Medtronic, and 
Nevro have unique functionality and technological specifications. Six parameters 
in device control can potentially be targeted and elicit various harms, 
including loss of therapeutic effect, accelerated battery drainage, paresthesia 
in unintended locations, muscle weakness or dysfunction, tissue burn, and 
electrical shock.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the history of implantable medical device hacking, SCS 
systems may also be susceptible to manipulation. As the prevalence of SCS use 
increases and SCS systems continuously evolve in the direction of wireless 
control and compatibility with mobile devices, appropriate measures should be 
taken by manufacturers and governmental agencies to ensure safety.

Painful diabetic polyneuropathy (PDPN) and painful polyneuropathies of other 
origins are associated with significant personal and societal burdens with 
treatments limited to symptomatic management. Treatment options include 
antidepressants, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) analogs, opioids, and topical 
analgesics, which are intended to alleviate pain and symptoms of neuropathy, but 
limited data are available on their efficacy. Paresthesia-based low-frequency 
spinal cord stimulation (LF-SCS) is considered a last-resort treatment modality 
for PDPN patients. In a large-scale RCT of neuropathic low back and leg pain, 
high-frequency SCS at 10 kHz (10 kHz SCS) was shown to provide superior pain 
relief that is not dependent on paresthesia and a higher responder rate than LF 
SCS. This retrospective case series includes data from six patients with painful 
peripheral neuropathies, including PDPN, idiopathic polyneuropathy, and chronic 
inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, who were candidates for 10 kHz SCS in 
routine commercial practice. All patients reported a reduction in verbal 
numerical rating scale (VNRS) pain score at last follow-up (2.7 ± 0.9) compared 
with baseline (7.0 ± 0.9). Out of five patients with information available at 
last follow-up, two were completely off their pain medications and two reduced 
their dose by over 40%. Similarly, at last follow-up, three out of five patients 
reported sensory improvement in their lower limbs. In conclusion, 10 kHz SCS 
treatment resulted in significant pain relief in all the patients, decreased 
reliance on pain medication, and improved lower limb sensory function in the 
majority of patients.

OBJECTIVE: Vestibular migraine (VM) is the most common neurologic cause of 
vertigo among adults. However, there are no specifically studied or approved 
rescue therapies for acute VM attacks. This study describes how external 
trigeminal nerve stimulation (eTNS) using the Cefaly® (CEFALY Technology, 
Seraing, Belgium) device relieves acute VM episodes.
METHODS: Single-center, retrospective review of 19 patients with acute VM 
attacks (seen between May 2018 and June 2019) treated with 20-min eTNS. Prior to 
treatment, patients graded the severity of their vertigo/headache using a 
10-point visual analog scale (VAS) with 0 representing no vertigo/headache, and 
10 representing the worst imaginable vertigo/headache. After eTNS, patients 
graded their vertigo/headache using the same VAS 15 min. In addition, bedside 
neuro-otologic examination was performed before and after treatment.
RESULTS: 19/19 patients reported improvement in vertigo severity. Mean vertigo 
severity was 6.6 (±2.1; median 7) before eTNS, and 2.7 (±2.6; median 3) 
following treatment; mean improvement in vertigo was 61.3% (±32.6; median 
50.0%). During VM episodes, 14/19 experienced headache. Mean headache severity 
was 4.8 (±2.4; median 4.5) before eTNS, and was 1.4 (±2.4; median 0) following 
treatment; mean improvement in headache was 77.2% (±32.7; median 100.0%). 
Neuro-otologic examination was normal during VM attacks in all except Patient 7 
who had spontaneous upbeat nystagmus which resolved after eTNS. Other 
improvements include improvement of eye pressure, head pressure, and chronic 
facial pain. No intolerable side effects were reported.
CONCLUSION: This study provides preliminary evidence that eTNS is a novel, 
non-invasive, safe and effective treatment for acute VM attacks.

BACKGROUND: The effect of pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) stimulation for 
alleviating cervical radicular pain has been demonstrated in several previous 
studies.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of PRF with ultrasound (US) 
guidance in patients with chronic cervical radicular pain that was refractory to 
repeated transforaminal epidural steroid injections (TFESIs).
STUDY DESIGN: A prospective outcome study.
SETTING: The outpatient clinic of a single academic medical center.
METHODS: This study included 49 patients with chronic cervical radicular pain, 
unresponsive to repeated TFESIs, and who underwent PRF stimulation under US 
guidance. Using US, a cannula was inserted toward the cervical spinal nerve. The 
pain intensity was evaluated using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS-11) for 
cervical radicular pain at pretreatment and 1, 3, and 6 months posttreatment; 
and the Neck Disability Index (NDI) was used for evaluating functional 
disability before treatment and 6 months posttreatment. Successful pain relief 
was defined as >= 50% reduction in the NRS-11 score as compared with the score 
before treatment.
RESULTS: Cervical radicular pain was significantly reduced at 1, 3, and 6 months 
post-PRF (P < 0.001). At 6 months post-PRF, functional disability (NDI score) 
had significantly reduced, and 63.3% of the patients achieved successful pain 
relief.
LIMITATIONS: The small number of included patients and no long-term follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: PRF stimulation under the guidance of US is a potentially effective 
treatment method for managing refractory chronic cervical radicular pain.

BACKGROUND: Smoking adversely impacts pain-related outcomes of spinal cord 
stimulation (SCS). However, the proportion of SCS patients at risk of worse 
outcomes is limited by an incomplete knowledge of smoking prevalence in this 
population. Thus, the primary aim of this systematic review is to determine the 
prevalence of smoking in adults with chronic pain treated with SCS.
METHODS: A comprehensive search of databases from 1 January 1980 to 3 January 
2019 was conducted. Eligible study designs included (1) randomized trials; (2) 
prospective and retrospective cohort studies; and (3) cross-sectional studies. 
The risk of bias was assessed using a tool specifically developed for prevalence 
studies. A total of 1619 records were screened, 19 studies met inclusion 
criteria, and the total number of participants was 10 838.
RESULTS: Thirteen studies had low or moderate risk of bias, and six had a high 
risk of bias. All 19 studies reported smoking status and the pooled prevalence 
was 38% (95% CI 30% to 47%). The pooled prevalence in 6 studies of peripheral 
vascular diseases was 56% (95% CI 42% to 69%), the pooled prevalence of smoking 
in 11 studies of lumbar spine diagnoses was 28% (95% CI 20% to 36%) and the 
pooled prevalence in 2 studies of refractory angina was 44% (95% CI 31% to 58%).
CONCLUSIONS: The estimated prevalence of smoking in SCS patients is 2.5 times 
greater than the general population. Future research should focus on 
development, testing and deployment of tailored smoking cessation treatments for 
SCS patients.

Primary progressive multiple sclerosis is a poorly understood disease entity 
with no specific prognostic biomarkers and scarce therapeutic options. We aimed 
to identify disease activity biomarkers in multiple sclerosis by performing an 
RNA sequencing approach in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a discovery 
cohort of 44 untreated patients with multiple sclerosis belonging to different 
clinical forms and activity phases of the disease, and 12 healthy control 
subjects. A validation cohort of 58 patients with multiple sclerosis and 26 
healthy control subjects was included in the study to replicate the RNA 
sequencing findings. The RNA sequencing revealed an interleukin 1 beta (IL1B) 
signature in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis. Subsequent 
immunophenotyping pointed to blood monocytes as responsible for the IL1B 
signature observed in this group of patients. Functional experiments at baseline 
measuring apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) speck 
formation showed that the NOD-leucine rich repeat and pyrin containing protein 3 
(NLRP3) inflammasome was overactive in monocytes from patients with primary 
progressive multiple sclerosis, and canonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation with 
a combination of ATP plus lipopolysaccharide was associated with increased IL1B 
production in this group of patients. Primary progressive multiple sclerosis 
patients with high IL1B gene expression levels in peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells progressed significantly faster compared to patients with low IL1B levels 
based on the time to reach an EDSS of 6.0 and the Multiple Sclerosis Severity 
Score. In agreement with peripheral blood findings, both NLRP3 and IL1B 
expression in brain tissue from patients with primary progressive multiple 
sclerosis was mainly restricted to cells of myeloid lineage. Treatment of mice 
with a specific NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor attenuated established experimental 
autoimmune encephalomyelitis disease severity and improved CNS histopathology. 
NLRP3 inflammasome-specific inhibition was also effective in reducing axonal 
damage in a model of lipopolysaccharide-neuroinflammation using organotypic 
cerebellar cultures. Altogether, these results point to a role of IL1B and the 
NLRP3 inflammasome as prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target, 
respectively, in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis.

BACKGROUND: Stimulation of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) in the treatment of 
chronic, intractable pain has shown excellent clinical results in multiple 
published studies, including a large prospective, randomized, controlled trial. 
Both safety and efficacy have been demonstrated utilizing this therapeutic 
approach for many chronic complaints. Continued assessment of neuromodulation 
therapies, such as DRG stimulation, are not only an important aspect of vigilant 
care, but are also necessary for the evaluation for safety.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Safety and complaint records for DRG and spinal cord 
stimulation (SCS) stimulation were obtained from the manufacturer, analyzed and 
compiled to further assess ongoing device safety. Complaint event data were 
stratified according to complain type as well as overall rates. Data from 
similar time periods were compared between epidural neurostimulation devices by 
the same manufacturer as well as rates reported in the literature.
RESULTS: Overall, DRG stimulation device event rates were lower or comparable to 
similar epidurally placed neurostimulation devices. Rates of events varied from 
0 to 1.0% for DRG stimulation (n >500+ implants) which was similar to the event 
rate for SCS by the same manufacturer (n >2000+ implants). In comparison, 
complaints and adverse events ranged from 0 to 14% for SCS in the literature.
DISCUSSIONS: The current results from a large consecutive cohort obtained from 
manufacturer records indicates that DRG stimulation demonstrates an excellent 
safety profile. Reported event rates are similar to previously reported adverse 
event and complaint rates in the literature for this therapy. Similarly, safety 
events rates were lower or similar to previously reported rates for SCS, further 
demonstrating the comparative safety of this neuromodulation technique for 
chronic pain treatment.

Chronic osteoarthritis pain is an increasing worldwide problem. Treatment for 
osteoarthritis pain is generally inadequate or fraught with potential 
toxicities. Botulinum toxins (BoNTs) are potent inhibitors of neuropeptide 
release. Paralytic toxicity is due to inhibition at the neuromuscular junction, 
and this effect has been utilized for treatments of painful dystonias. Pain 
relief following BoNT muscle injection has been noted to be more significant 
than muscle weakness and hypothesized to occur because of the inhibition of 
peripheral neuropeptide release and reduction of peripheral sensitization. 
Because of this observation, BoNT has been studied as an intra-articular (IA) 
analgesic for chronic joint pain. In clinical trials, BoNT appears to be 
effective for nociceptive joint pain. No toxicity has been reported. In 
preclinical models of joint pain, BoNT is similarly effective. Examination of 
the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and the central nervous system has shown that 
catalytically active BoNT is retrogradely transported by neurons and then 
transcytosed to afferent synapses in the brain. This suggests that pain relief 
may also be due to the central effects of the drug. In summary, BoNT appears to 
be safe and effective for the treatment of chronic joint pain. The long-term 
effects of IA BoNT are still being determined.

Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN) typically is accompanied by painful 
symptoms. Several therapeutic agents have been tried for symptomatic relief, but 
with varying results. The use of non-invasive neuromodulation (NINM) is a 
potential treatment option for DPN. The objective of our study is to evaluate 
NINM effects on pain rating and nerve conduction velocity in DPN patients. The 
search was carried out in seven databases until Aug 30th, 2019. Finally, twenty 
studies met the inclusion criteria. We found a significant reduction of pain 
scores by central NINMs (effect size [ES] =  - 0.75, 95% CI =  - 1.35 
to - 0.14), but not by the overall peripheral techniques (electrical and 
electromagnetic) (ES =  - 0.58, 95% CI =  - 1.23 to 0.07). However, the subgroup 
of peripheral electrical NINMs reported a significant higher effect 
(ES =  - 0.84, 95% CI =  - 1.57 to - 0.11) compared to electromagnetic 
techniques (ES = 0.21; 95% CI =  - 1.00 to 1.42, I2 = 95.3%) . Other subgroup 
analysis results show that NINMs effects are higher with intensive protocols and 
in populations with resistant symptoms or intolerance to analgesic medications. 
Besides, NINMs can increase motor nerves velocity (ES = 1.82; 95% CI = 1.47 to 
2.17), and there were no effects on sensory nerves velocity (ES = 0.01, 95% 
CI =  - 0.79 to 0.80). The results suggest that central and peripheral 
electrical NINMs could reduce neuropathic pain among DPN patients, without 
reported adverse events. Well-powered studies are needed to confirm that NINM 
techniques as an alternative effective and safe treatment option.

Oxaliplatin is a cornerstone chemotherapeutic used in the treatment of 
colorectal cancer, the third leading cause of death in Western countries. Most 
side effects of this platinum-containing drug are adequately managed in the 
clinic, although acute and long-term neurotoxicity still severely compromises 
the quality of life of patients treated with oxaliplatin. We have previously 
demonstrated that therapeutically relevant concentrations/doses of oxaliplatin 
lead to a reduction in intracellular pH in mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) 
neurons in vitro and in vivo and that this alteration sensitizes TRPA1 and TRPV1 
channels, which most likely mediate the allodynia associated with treatment. In 
this study, we show that oxaliplatin leads to a reduction of intracellular pH by 
forming adducts with neuronal haemoglobin, which acts in this setting as a 
proton buffer. Furthermore, we show that FDA-approved drugs that inhibit 
carbonic anhydrase (an enzyme that is linked to haemoglobin in intracellular pH 
homeostasis), ie, topiramate and acetazolamide, revert (1) oxaliplatin-induced 
cytosolic acidification and TRPA1 and TRPV1 modulation in DRG neurons in 
culture, (2) oxaliplatin-induced cytosolic acidification of DRG of treated 
animals, and (3) oxaliplatin-induced acute cold allodynia in mice while not 
affecting OHP-induced cytotoxicity on cancer cells. Our data would therefore 
suggest that reversal of oxaliplatin-induced cytosolic acidification is a viable 
strategy to minimize acute oxaliplatin-induced symptoms.

BACKGROUND: Low back pain is a very common disease. Many patients with chronic 
low back pain (CLBP) have been treated by complementary and alternative medicine 
such as acupuncture (AT) treatment. A type of AT, thread embedding acupuncture 
(TEA), consists of a thread that can continually stimulate at the AT points and 
has mechanical and chemical effects. Although TEA was widely used in clinical 
practice, there was little evidence of its efficacy and safety for CLBP.
METHODS: This clinical trial was randomized, controlled, assessor-blinded, 
two-armed, parallel, and conducted in multiple centers. Four Korean medical 
institutions recruited 38 outpatients with CLBP. The participants were randomly 
allocated to a treatment group (TEA combined with AT) or a control group (only 
AT) in a 1:1 ratio. All participants received conventional AT twice a week for 8 
weeks (16 sessions) at 15 AT points (GV3 and bilateral BL23, BL24, BL25, BL26, 
BL40, BL60, and EX-B5) and the treatment group participants additionally 
received TEA once a week for 8 weeks (8 sessions) on 10 AT points in the 
multifidus, spinal erector, and lumbar quadrate muscles. The primary outcome 
measure of this study was the change of visual analog scale (VAS) from baseline 
(0 week) to the end of intervention (8 weeks). Secondary outcome measures 
included clinically relevant improvement (minimal clinically important 
difference) and 3% to 50% decrease on VAS, disability level (Korean version of 
Roland and Morris disability questionnaire), quality of life (Korean version of 
European quality of life 5dimension), global assessment (patient global 
impression of change), economic analysis, credibility test, and safety 
assessment.
RESULTS: The treatment group showed a significant reduction in VAS scores when 
compared with the control group (-33.7 ± 25.1 vs -15.6 ± 17.0, P = .013). As for 
the secondary outcome measures, the treatment group showed significant 
difference in 50% decrease on VAS and patient global impression of change. There 
was no serious adverse event associated with TEA and AT.
CONCLUSION: This clinical trial documents the efficacy and safety of TEA 
combined with AT for the management of CLBP.

INTRODUCTION: Chronic pain remains an important public health problem as it 
continues to increase healthcare-related cost. Comorbidities like obesity have 
been associated with efficacy of spinal cord stimulator (SCS) therapy and worse 
outcomes. The goal of this study is to investigate the trends of obesity amongst 
hospitalized patients with SCS therapy as well as healthcare utilization 
outcomes.
METHODS: Using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) ninth and 
tenth procedure and diagnosis code, we investigated the National Inpatient 
Sample (NIS) for patients with SCS implants between 2011 and 2015. Patients 
received a diagnosis of obesity based on the following categories: class I, II 
and III obesity. Age, gender, and comorbid conditions of patients with obesity 
were matched 1:1 on propensity score to those without obesity diagnosis. Our 
primary outcome was defined as trend of obesity diagnosis. Our secondary 
outcome, healthcare utilization, included in-hospital cost, length of stay, and 
discharge location.
RESULTS: Between 2011 and 2015, a total of 3893 patients with SCS implants were 
identified (average age 56 ± 15 years, 58% female, 0.70 ± 1.1 Charlson 
Comorbidity Index, CCI). Of this cohort, 640 patients were identified as obese. 
The proportion of patients with obesity diagnosis increased significantly from 
13.75% in 2011 to 19.36% in 2015 (p < 0.001). After 1:1 matching on propensity 
score, 597 patients with obesity were successfully matched to 597 patients 
without obesity. The total hospital cost for SCS patients with obesity (median 
$104,845, IQR $74,648-144,292) was not significantly different from patients 
without obesity diagnosis (median $111,092, IQR $68,990-145,459) (p = 0.161).
CONCLUSIONS: The data from our study suggests that there is an increasing rate 
of obesity diagnosis amongst patients with SCS therapy. However, there was no 
difference in healthcare utilization between patients with and without obesity. 
Additional studies may provide more insight into our findings.

Experimental treatments for treating neuropathic pain include transcranial 
magnetic stimulation (TMS) and invasive electric motor cortex stimulation (iMCS) 
of the primary motor cortex (M1). Mechanisms of action of both methods, however, 
remain largely elusive. Within this paper, we focus on animal-based experiments 
in order to investigate the biological mechanisms that are involved in 
alleviating pain by use of TMS and/or iMCS. Therefore, this paper systematically 
reviewed the animal-based evidence on these mechanisms. Multiple online 
databases were systematically searched and retrieved articles were assessed 
using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Twenty-three suitable 
articles were included; six on TMS and seventeen on iMCS. In general, iMCS and 
TMS were found to impact the primary motor cortex structure and function in 
animals. Furthermore, structural and functional changes within the thalamus, 
striatum, periaqueductal grey, rostral ventromedial medulla and dorsal horn were 
reported to occur. Although widespread, all areas in which structural and 
functional changes occurred after TMS and iMCS have been found to be 
interconnected anatomically. This could provide a rationale for future 
investigations of treating neuropathic pain by use of neuromodulation.

Peripheral neuropathies can have various origins, from genetic to acquired 
causes, and affect altogether a large group of people in the world. Current 
available therapies aim at helping the disease symptoms but not to correct or 
stop the development of the disease. Primary neuronal cultures represent an 
essential tool in the study of events related to peripheral neuropathies as they 
allow to isolate the affected cell types, often originating in complex tissues 
in which they account for only a few percentage of cells. They provide a 
powerful system to identifying or testing compounds with potential therapeutic 
effect in the treatment of those diseases. Friedreich's ataxia is an autosomal 
recessive neurodegenerative disorder, which is characterized by a progressive 
spinocerebellar and sensory ataxia. Proprioceptive neurons of the dorsal root 
ganglia (DRG) are the primary affected cells. The disease is triggered by a 
mutation in the gene FXN which leads to a reduction of the frataxin protein. In 
order to study the neurophysiopathology of the disease at the cellular and 
molecular levels, we have established a model of primary cultures of DRG sensory 
neurons in which we induce the loss of the frataxin protein. With such a model 
we can alleviate the issues related to the complexity of DRG tissues and low 
amount of sensory neuron material in adult mouse. Hereby, we provide a protocol 
of detailed and optimized methods to obtain high yield of healthy mouse DRG 
sensory neuron in culture.

BACKGROUND: Neurophysiologic biomarkers are needed for clinical trials of 
therapies for myotonic dystrophy (DM1). We characterized muscle properties, 
spinal reflexes (H-reflexes), and trans-cortical long-latency reflexes (LLRs) in 
a cohort with mild/moderate DM1.
METHODS: Twenty-four people with DM1 and 25 matched controls underwent 
assessment of tibial nerve H-reflexes and soleus muscle twitch properties. 
Quadriceps LLRs were elicited by delivering an unexpected perturbation during a 
single-limb squat (SLS) visuomotor tracking task.
RESULTS: DM1 was associated with decreased H-reflex depression. The efficacy of 
doublet stimulation was enhanced, yielding an elevated double-single twitch 
ratio. DM1 participants demonstrated greater error during the SLS task. DM1 
individuals with the least-robust LLR responses showed the greatest loss of 
spinal H-reflex depression.
CONCLUSIONS: DM1 is associated with abnormalities of muscle twitch properties. 
Co-occurring alterations of spinal and trans-cortical reflex properties 
underscore the central nervous system manifestations of this disorder and may 
assist in gauging efficacy during clinical trials.

The molecular mechanisms of pain associated with alphaherpesvirus latency are 
not clear. We hypothesize that the voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSC) on the 
dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons controlling electrical impulses may have 
abnormal activity during latent viral infection and reactivation. We used herpes 
simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) to infect the human DRG-derived neuronal cell line 
HD10.6 in order to study the establishment and maintenance of viral latency, 
viral reactivation, and changes in the functional expression of VGSCs. 
Differentiated cells exhibited robust tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive sodium 
currents, and acute infection significantly reduced the functional expression of 
VGSCs within 24 h and completely abolished VGSC activity within 3 days. A 
quiescent state of infection mimicking latency can be achieved in the presence 
of acyclovir (ACV) for 7 days followed by 5 days of ACV washout, and then the 
viruses can remain dormant for another 3 weeks. It was noted that during the 
establishment of HSV-1 latency, the loss of VGSC activity caused by HSV-1 
infection could not be blocked by ACV treatment. However, neurons with continued 
ACV treatment for another 4 days showed a gradual recovery of VGSC functional 
expression. Furthermore, the latently infected neurons exhibited higher VGSC 
activity than controls. The overall regulation of VGSCs by HSV-1 during 
quiescent infection was proved by increased transcription and possible 
translation of Nav1.7. Together, these observations demonstrated a very complex 
pattern of electrophysiological changes during HSV infection of DRG neurons, 
which may have implications for understanding of the mechanisms of 
virus-mediated pain linked to latency and reactivation.IMPORTANCE The 
reactivation of herpesviruses, most commonly varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and 
pseudorabies virus (PRV), may cause cranial nerve disorder and unbearable pain. 
Clinical studies have also reported that HSV-1 causes postherpetic neuralgia and 
chronic occipital neuralgia in humans. The current work meticulously studies the 
functional expression profile changes of VGSCs during the processes of HSV-1 
latency establishment and reactivation using human dorsal root ganglion-derived 
neuronal HD10.6 cells as an in vitro model. Our results indicated that VGSC 
activity was eliminated upon infection but steadily recovered during latency 
establishment and that latent neurons exhibited even higher VGSC activity. This 
finding advances our knowledge of how ganglion neurons generate uncharacteristic 
electrical impulses due to abnormal VGSC functional expression influenced by the 
latent virus.

BACKGROUND: Intractable neck and upper limb pain has historically been 
challenging to treat with conventional spinal cord stimulation (SCS) being 
limited by obtaining effective paresthesia coverage.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and effectiveness of the 10-kHz SCS system, a 
paresthesia-independent therapy, in the treatment of neck and upper limb pain.
METHODS: Subjects with chronic, intractable neck and/or upper limb pain of ≥5 cm 
(on a 0-10 cm visual analog scale [VAS]) were enrolled in 6 US centers following 
an investigational device exemption from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
and institutional review board approval. Each subject was implanted with 2 
epidural leads spanning C2-C6 vertebral bodies. Subjects with successful trial 
stimulation were implanted with a Senza® system (Nevro Corp) and included in the 
evaluation of the primary safety and effectiveness endpoints.
RESULTS: In the per protocol population, the primary endpoint (≥50% pain relief 
at 3 mo) was achieved in 86.7% (n = 39/45) subjects. Compared to baseline, 
subjects reported a significant reduction (P < .001) in their mean (± standard 
error of the mean) VAS scores at 12-mo assessment for neck pain (7.6 ± 0.2 cm, 
n = 42 vs 1.5 ± 0.3 cm, n = 37) and upper limb pain (7.1 ± 0.3 cm, n = 24 vs 
1.0 ± 0.2 cm, n = 20). At 12-mo assessment, 89.2% of subjects with neck pain and 
95.0% with upper limb pain had ≥50% pain relief from baseline, 95.0% reported to 
be "satisfied/very satisfied" and 30.0% either eliminated or reduced their 
opioid intake.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, 10-kHz SCS can treat intractable neck and upper limb 
pain with stable long-term outcomes.

Paclitaxel (PTX), a drug widely used in lung cancer, has serious limitations 
including the development of peripheral neurotoxicity, which may lead to 
treatment discontinuation and therapy failure. The transport of PTX in large 
cationic liposomes could avoid this undesirable effect, improving the patient's 
prognosis. PTX was encapsulated in cationic liposomes with two different sizes, 
MLV (180-200 nm) and SUV (80-100 nm). In both cases, excellent biocompatibility 
and improved internalization and antitumor effect of PTX were observed in human 
and mice lung cancer cells in culture, multicellular spheroids and cancer stem 
cells (CSCs). In addition, both MLV and SUV with a polyethylene glycol (PEG) 
shell, induced a greater tumor volume reduction than PTX (56.4 % and 57.1 % vs. 
36.7 %, respectively) in mice. Interestingly, MLV-PEG-PTX did not induce either 
mechanical or heat hypersensitivity whereas SUV-PEG-PTX produced a similar 
response to free PTX. Analysis of PTX distribution showed a very low 
concentration of the drug in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) with MLV-PEG-PTX, but 
not with SUV-PEG-PTX or free PTX. These results support the hypothesis that PTX 
induces peripheral neuropathy by penetrating the endothelial fenestrations of 
the DRG (80-100 nm, measured in mice). In conclusion, our larger liposomes 
(MLV-PEG-PTX) not only showed biocompatibility, antitumor activity against CSCs, 
and in vitro and in vivo antitumor effect that improved PTX free activity, but 
also protected from PTX-induced painful peripheral neuropathy. These advantages 
could be used as a new strategy of lung cancer chemotherapy to increase the PTX 
activity and reduce its side effects.

BACKGROUND: Chronic orofacial pain (COP) patients often perceive the painful 
face area as "swollen" without clinical signs; such self-reported illusions of 
the face are termed perceptual distortion (PD). The pathophysiological 
mechanisms underlying PD remain elusive.
OBJECTIVE: To test the neuromodulatory effect of repetitive transcranial 
magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on PD in healthy individuals, to gain insight into 
the cortical mechanisms underlying PD.
METHODS: PD was induced experimentally by injections of local anesthetic (LA) 
around the infraorbital nerve and measured as perceived size changes of the 
affected area. Participants were randomly allocated to inhibitory rTMS (n = 26) 
or sham rTMS (n = 26) group. The participants rated PD at baseline, 6 min after 
LA, immediately, 20 and 40 min after rTMS. The rTMS (inhibitory and sham) was 
applied to face (lip) representation area of primary somatosensory cortex (SI) 
as an intervention at 10 min after the LA, when the magnitude of PD is large. As 
inhibitory rTMS, continuous theta-burst stimulation paradigm (50 Hz) for 40s was 
employed to inhibit cortical activity.
RESULTS: We demonstrated a significant decrease in the magnitude of PD 
immediately and 20 min after the application of inhibitory rTMS compared with 
sham rTMS (P < 0.006). In two control experiments, we also showed that 
peripheral muscle stimulation and stimulation of a cortical region other than 
the lip representation area had no effect on the magnitude of the PD.
CONCLUSIONS: Inhibitory rTMS applied to a somatotopical-relevant cortical region 
modulates PD of the face in healthy individuals and could potentially have 
therapeutic implications for COP patients.

BACKGROUND: Surgical options for thoracic pain are limited and carry significant 
risk and morbidity. Spinal cord stimulation has the potential to be used for 
treatment of thoracic pain, as it has been useful for treating multiple types of 
chronic pain. Conventional tonic stimulation is limited in the treatment of 
thoracic pain, as it can produce paresthesia that is difficult to localize. 
Conversely, high-frequency spinal cord stimulation (HF-SCS) does not activate 
dorsal column A Beta fibers and does not produce paresthesia, and thus may be 
more beneficial in treating thoracic back pain not manageable with tonic 
stimulation.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate (1) the efficacy of 10 kHz HF-SCS for patients with 
chronic thoracic pain; and (2) appropriate paresthesia-free lead placement and 
programming targets for 10 kHz HF-SCS for patients with chronic thoracic pain.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series.
SETTING: Multisite academic medical center or pain clinic.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed on 19 patients with thoracic 
back pain who underwent HF-SCS implantation. These patients had lead placement 
and stimulation between the T1-T6 vertebral levels. Outcome measures collected 
include location of device implant, stimulation settings, and pain scores at 
baseline, end of trial, and 1, 6, and 12 months postimplant. Follow-up phone 
calls collected information on if the patient reported functional improvement, 
improved sleep, or decreased pain medication usage. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test 
compared differences in mean pain scores across time points.
RESULTS: Significantly decreased Visual Analog Scale scores were observed with 
17/19 (89.5%) patients demonstrating response to therapy (> 50% reduction in 
pain scores). These results were sustained relative to baseline at 1, 6, and 12 
months postimplant, depending on length of follow-up. Many patients also 
reported functional improvement (17/19), improved sleep (14/19), and reduction 
in use of pain medications after implantation (9/19). A total of 15/19 patients 
reported best relief when contacts over T1 or T2 vertebrae were used for 
stimulation.
LIMITATIONS: This study is limited by its retrospective design. Additionally, 
including documentation from multiple sites may be prone to selection and 
abstraction bias. Data were also not available for all patients at all time 
points.
CONCLUSIONS: HF-SCS may be a viable option for significant, long-lasting pain 
relief for thoracic back pain. There may also be evidence for anatomically based 
lead placement and programming for thoracic back pain. Randomized, controlled 
trials with extended follow-up are needed to further evaluate this therapy.

INTRODUCTION: Patients with neuropathic pain have altered proteomic and 
neuropeptide constituents in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compared to controls. 
Tonic spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has demonstrated differential expression of 
neuropeptides in CSF before and after treatment suggesting potential mechanisms 
of action. Burst-SCS is an evidence-based paraesthesia free waveform utilised 
for neuropathic pain with a potentially different mechanistic action to tonic 
SCS. This study examines the dynamic biological changes of CSF at a cellular and 
proteome level after Burst-SCS.
METHODS: Patients with neuropathic pain selected for SCS had CSF sampled prior 
to implant of SCS and following 8 weeks of continuous Burst-SCS. Baseline and 
8-week pain scores with demographics were recorded. T cell frequencies were 
analysed by flow cytometry, proteome analysis was performed using mass 
spectrometry and secreted cytokines, chemokines and neurotrophins were measured 
by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
RESULTS: 4 patients (2 females, 2 males) with a mean age of 51 years (+/-SEM 
2.74, SD 5.48) achieved a reduction in pain of >50% following 8 weeks of 
Burst-SCS. Analysis of the CSF proteome indicated a significant alteration in 
protein expression most related to synapse assembly and immune regulators. There 
was significantly lower expression of the proteins: growth hormone A1 (PRL), 
somatostatin (SST), nucleobindin-2 (NUCB2), Calbindin (CALB1), acyl-CoA binding 
protein (DBI), proSAAS (PCSK1N), endothelin-3 (END3) and cholecystokinin (CCK) 
after Burst-SCS. The concentrations of secreted chemokines and cytokines and the 
frequencies of T cells were not significantly changed following Burst-SCS.
CONCLUSION: This study characterised the alteration in the CSF proteome in 
response to burst SCS in vivo. Functional analysis indicated that the 
alterations in the CSF proteome is predominately linked to synapse assembly and 
immune effectors. Individual protein analysis also suggests potential 
supraspinal mechanisms.

OBJECTIVE: We present a case of a young woman diagnosed with complex regional 
pain syndrome (CRPS) who underwent spinal cord stimulator (SCS) implantation. 
She had 2 successful pregnancies following implantation.
DESIGN: We evaluated the electronic medical records of the patient following SCS 
implantation and while pregnant with her second and third children. A phone 
interview was conducted after her third pregnancy to discuss her experience with 
SCS use during and after pregnancy.
SETTING: Physical medicine and rehabilitation pain management clinic and 
obstetrician clinic, affiliated with the Medical College of Wisconsin in 
Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
SUBJECT: A 26-year-old woman with history of CRPS type I.
RESULTS: This 26-year-old woman was diagnosed with CRPS type I after left knee 
surgery. All conservative treatments had failed prior to her undergoing SCS 
implantation after the birth of her first child. SCS implantation brought near 
complete resolution of her symptoms. When she became pregnant with her second 
child, she turned off her SCS. Her CRPS symptoms intensified, but she had a 
normal pregnancy. She turned the SCS back on postpartum and elected to continue 
its use throughout her third pregnancy. She had a normal pregnancy, and her CRPS 
symptoms were well controlled. The patient and her children are currently 
healthy. Her SCS remains functional and effective.
CONCLUSION: Both an SCS and many medications used for pain management in CRPS 
could cause harm to both mother and fetus in pregnancy. Further research must be 
done to determine the safety and efficacy of SCS use in pregnancy.

BACKGROUND: Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) activates the dorsal column fibers 
using electrical stimuli. Current SCS systems function in fixed-output mode, 
delivering the same stimulus regardless of spinal cord (SC) activation.
OBJECTIVE: To present long-term outcomes of a novel closed-loop SCS system that 
aims to maintain the SC activation near a set target level and within a 
therapeutic window for each patient. SC activation is measured through the 
evoked compound action potential (ECAP) generated by each stimulus pulse.
METHODS: Fifty patients with lower back and/or leg pain who were successfully 
trialed received a permanent system (Evoke; Saluda Medical, Sydney, Australia). 
Ratings of pain (visual analog scale), quality of life, function, sleep, and 
medication use were collected at baseline and at each visit. SC activation 
levels were reported in summary statistics. The therapeutic window for each 
individual patient was defined as the range of ECAP amplitudes between sensation 
threshold and uncomfortably strong stimulation.
RESULTS: At 12 mo, the proportion of patients with ≥50% relief was 76.9% (back), 
79.3% (leg), and 81.4% (overall), and the proportion with ≥80% pain relief was 
56.4% (back), 58.6% (leg), and 53.5% (overall). Patients spent a median of 84.9% 
of their time with stimulation in their therapeutic window, and 68.8% (22/32) 
eliminated or reduced their opioid intake. Statistically significant 
improvements in secondary outcomes were observed.
CONCLUSION: The majority of patients experienced more than 80% pain relief with 
stable SC activation, as measured by ECAP amplitude at 12 mo, providing evidence 
for the long-term effectiveness of the Evoke closed-loop SCS system.

PURPOSE: As the prevalence of pain increases with age, taking too much 
medication can lead to negative side effects in elderly patients. While evidence 
in the literature has shown that clinical hypnosis is effective in an adult 
population, there are few studies in an aging population and efficacy has never 
been established in a home care setting. The goal of this study was to determine 
the effects of a hypnosis program delivered during home care interventions in 
elderly women during a 12-week period.
METHODS: This pilot trial took place from April 2016 to October 2017 at Limoges, 
France. Fifteen elderly women with chronic pain participated (81 (65-87) years 
old). All participants presented chronic pain for more than 6 months (inclusion 
criteria: average pain score >4/10). Participants took part in three 15-min 
hypnosis sessions separated by four to six weeks. Each hypnosis session was 
personalized and carried out with induction, pain perception alteration, and 
post-hypnotic suggestions. Pain perception and pain interference were evaluated 
with the Brief Pain Inventory questionnaire, and compared between before and 
after the 12-week hypnosis program.
FINDINGS: Hypnosis home care program significantly improved scores on worst (8.9 
to 6.7, P < 0.001), average (6.8 to 5.1, P < 0.001), and current pain perception 
(6.5 to 3.9, P < 0.001), pain interference with physical activity (P < 0.001) 
and with socio-affective factors (P < 0.01).
IMPLICATIONS: Taken together, these findings show that a hypnosis intervention 
is feasible and effective to manage pain in an elderly population.

BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) affects 30% to 40% 
of patients with cancer with long-lasting disability. Scrambler therapy (ST) 
appeared to benefit patients in uncontrolled trials, so we performed a 
randomized sham-controlled Phase II trial of ST.
METHODS: The primary end point was "average pain" after 28 days on the Numeric 
Rating Scale. Each received ten 30-minute sessions of ST on the dermatomes above 
the painful areas, or sham treatment on the back, typically at L3-5 where the 
nerve roots would enter the spinal cord. Outcomes included the Brief Pain 
Inventory (BPI)-CIPN and the EORTC CIPN-20 scale. Patients were evaluated before 
treatment (day 0), day 10, and days 28, 60, and 90.
RESULTS: Data regarding pain as a primary outcome were collected for 33 of the 
35 patients. There were no significant differences between the sham and the 
"real" ST group at day 10, 28, 60, or 90, for average pain, the BPI, or EORTC 
CIPN-20. Individual responses were noted during the ST treatment on the real 
arm, but most dissipated by day 30. There was improvement in the sensory 
subscale of the CIPN-20 at 2 months in the "real" group (P = .14). All "real" 
patients wanted to continue treatment if available.
DISCUSSION: We observed no difference between sham and real ST CIPN treatment. 
Potential reasons include at least the following: ST does not work; the sham 
treatment had some effect; small sample size with heterogeneous patients; 
misplaced electrodes on an area of nonpainful but damaged nerves; or a 
combination of these factors.

BACKGROUND: Stimulation of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG-S) has been shown to be 
an efficacious treatment option for refractory neuropathic pain syndromes. 
However, placement of the percutaneous leads for trial implantation can be 
challenging in patients with prior spinal surgical interventions resulting in 
anatomical changes and adhesions.
METHODS: This technical report describes the transgrade placement of DRG-S leads 
in 4 patients with back pain surgery histories in whom secondary to specific 
anatomical pathologies the traditional anterograde placement of DRG-S leads was 
not feasible.
RESULTS: We used a transgrade placement approach, entering superior and 
contralateral to the target level of placement, resulting in uncomplicated and 
effective placement of DRG-S leads.
CONCLUSIONS: Transgrade lead placement for DRG-S may be an efficacious 
alternative to traditional anterograde DRG lead placement in cases where 
interlaminar access below the level of the DRG is not available, or desirable. 
Further studies are needed to clarify the safety and applicability of this 
approach.

INTRODUCTION: Lead migration has been regarded as a frequent complication after 
percutaneous spinal cord stimulation (SCS). Thus far, repeated reinsertion of 
leads or replacement of paddle electrodes after removing percutaneous leads has 
been performed, but a salvage surgical technique using the remaining electrode 
has not been reported. Here, we describe a case in which unilateral lead 
migration was successfully treated with the insertion of a paddle electrode.
CASE SUMMARY: A 44-year-old male paraplegic patient with chronic neuropathic 
pain in the right leg and low back for 7 years underwent a percutaneous spinal 
cord stimulation procedure 5 times over 2 years because of repeated unilateral 
lead migration. The left lead underwent repeated migration and was difficult to 
reinsert due to epidural adhesion. After confirming the position and stimulation 
area of the remaining lead, we decided to insert another paddle electrode beside 
the remaining lead. We performed a T10 laminotomy and inserted a paddle 
electrode on the right side, using it in combination with the previous left 
lead. After surgery, the patient was satisfied with a wide coverage area.
DISCUSSION: We recommend salvage additional paddle electrode insertion rather 
than removing both leads during revision SCS. This surgical method increases the 
possibility of covering the dorsal column (DC) of the spinal cord, is cost 
effective, and decreases the possibility of failing to cover dorsal column using 
the paddle electrode during open surgery because the remaining lead's position 
and stimulation area guide the insertion of the additional paddle lead.

Evidence for the Efficacy of Scrambler Therapy for Cancer Pain: A Systematic 
Review.

Delhi, India.

BACKGROUND: Certain types of cancer pain have remained hard to control even by 
highly skilled pain experts. Uncontrolled cancer pain can have severe effects on 
quality of life, physical functioning, and leads to psychological distress. From 
this perspective, nonpharmacologic modalities of treatment are important. 
Neuromodulatory techniques, such as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation 
and scrambler therapy (ST), have gained popularity in recent times. ST is a 
relatively new therapy that has been used for the management of cancer pain 
resistant to pharmacologic management. Several studies have shown that ST is an 
effective therapy for this type of pain.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to detect possible gaps in the literature 
regarding the efficacy of ST for cancer pain and formulate recommendations for 
research through a systematic review of the literature.
STUDY DESIGN: A systematic review of the literature was performed following the 
recommendations of the PRISMA Statement.
METHODS: PubMed and EMBASE were searched for studies that met the inclusion 
criteria using a predetermined search strategy. Reference list of retrieved 
studies and Google Scholar were used to verify that no relevant studies had been 
omitted. Data were extracted from the studies with a data extraction sheet. A 
qualitative analyses of the extracted data was undertaken.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven studies were retrieved. Ten were articles that were 
categorized as literature reviews, including 7 general literature reviews not 
following a specific review methodology, 1 editorial, and 2 systematic reviews. 
Seventeen were original studies, including 2 single-arm trials, 1 randomized 
controlled trial, 4 pilot trials, 4 case reports, 2 retrospective studies, and 4 
prospective studies. By and large, the available literature supports the use of 
ST as an effective therapy for the management of refractory cancer pain. 
However, the level of evidence for its application to cancer pain is not 
particularly strong, and improvement in pain with ST may even be owing to a 
placebo effect.
LIMITATIONS: This study was not a meta-review. Because of the limited number of 
clinical trials on ST in cancer pain, such a meta-review could not meaningfully 
be performed.
CONCLUSIONS: Methodologically sound, large randomized control trials are needed 
in this area. However at this stage, ST may be considered a good option for 
cancer patients suffering from pain that does not respond to pharmacologic 
treatment.

BACKGROUND: Painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) is a common complication secondary 
to diabetes mellitus. Nav1.8 is an isoform of voltage-gated sodium channels and 
its expression regulation is closely related with PDN. MicroRNA-145 (miR-145) is 
involved in the occurrence and development of neuropathic pain. TargetScan 
software has revealed that Nav1.8 (SCN10A) is the major target of miR-145. 
However, its function between miR-145 and Nav1.8 in PDN is unknown.
OBJECTIVES: We aim to explore the regulatory effect of miR-145 on the expression 
and function of Nav1.8, which plays a pivotal role in precluding the advancement 
of neuropathic mechanical hyperalgesia in diabetic pain.
STUDY DESIGN: An experimental, animal study.
SETTING: An animal research facility at Nanjing Maternal and Child Health 
Institute, China.
METHODS: The paw mechanical withdrawal threshold (PMWT) of rats was assessed 
with the von Frey test. The adverse regulation of Nav1.8 by miR-145 was 
confirmed by a dual luciferase detection system in HEK293T cells. The mRNA level 
and expression of Nav1.8 in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons were assessed 
with real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR), western blotting and 
immunofluorescence assays following intrathecal injection of agomiR-145 in vitro 
and in vivo. Whole-cell patch-clamping was applied to assess alterations in the 
tetrodotoxin-resistant (TTX-R) sodium current (Nav1.8) in DRGs.
RESULTS: The PMWT was significantly decreased in rats following streptozotocin 
(STZ) injection on Day 7 and was maintained at a lower level on Day 28; this 
change was accompanied by changes in the expression of Nav1.8 in DRG neurons, 
which was increased 3 days after STZ injection and reached a maximal level on 
Day 14. The early knockdown of Nav1.8 with siRNA or agomiR-145 treatment on Day 
8 effectively precluded the deterioration of pain behaviors in STZ-treated rats. 
The luciferase intensity was significantly decreased in HEK293T cells expressing 
wild-type SCN10A infected with miR-145 mimic. In addition, Nav1.8 overexpression 
was significantly repressed via overexpression of miR-145 in cultured DRG 
neurons, and neuronal hyperexcitability was concomitantly decreased. 
Furthermore, the intrathecal administration of agomiR-145 elicited a significant 
decrease in Nav1.8 expression in DRG neurons from STZ-treated rats on Day 14.
LIMITATIONS: The causes of PDN are likely to be multifactorial and inflammatory 
markers, such as IL-6, IL-2, and TNF-?, are elevated in hyperglycemia and might 
be the precipitating factors that contribute to miR-145 dysregulation. The 
curative effect of miR-145 upregulation in reversal of pain behaviors at the 
stage of well-established PDN wasn't investigated in this study.
CONCLUSION: Early infection with a lentiviral vector overexpressing miR-145 
adversely regulated the expression and function of TTX-resistant Nav1.8 and 
abrogated the development of PDN. Therefore, miR-145 might be a potential 
therapeutic target for preventing PDN in the near future.

OBJECTIVE: To describe a novel technique of using peripheral nerve 
neuromodulation (PNNM) for the treatment of refractory, mesh-induced chronic 
pelvic pain. Chronic pelvic pain associated with mesh can be a debilitating 
complication and there is currently no consensus on treatment. PNNM has been 
shown to be successful in the treatment of post-traumatic neuralgias but has yet 
to be studied in mesh complications.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We present a case of a 50-year-old woman who had 
unrelenting pelvic pain after retropubic sling placement. She failed multiple 
therapies including medications, mesh removal, pelvic floor physical therapy, 
pudendal neuromodulation, and pelvic floor onabotulinumtoxinA trigger point 
injections.
RESULTS: The only treatment that provided temporary relief of this patient's 
pain was transvaginal trigger point injections along with a right pudendal nerve 
block using 40 mg triamcinolone and 0.5% ropivacaine. To help define if 
treatment at the site of her pain would provide relief, a series of blocks were 
done by advancing a needle retropubically to her area of pain and injecting 
triamcinolone and 0.5% ropivacaine. This injection, which corresponded to the 
previous tract of her retropubic sling, provided temporary, but profound, 
relief. PNNM was then done with placement of the electrode in the retropubic 
space at the site of her pain. This provided instantaneous relief of almost all 
of her pain symptoms. Twelve months postoperatively, the patient continued to 
have >90% improvement in her pain.
CONCLUSION: Focused PNNM is a simple procedure and can provide symptomatic 
relief for refractory postvaginal mesh pain.

PURPOSE: Evidence suggests that Patient-centred Medical Home (PCMH) model 
facilitates person-centred care and improves health-related quality of life for 
patients with chronic illness. This study aims to evaluate changes in 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL), before and after enrolment into a 
12-month integrated care program called 'WellNet'.
METHODS: This study includes 616 eligible consented patients aged 40 years and 
above with one or more chronic conditions from six general practices across 
Sydney, Australia. The WellNet program included a team of general practitioners 
(GPs) and clinical coordinators (CCs) providing patient-tailored care plans 
configured to individual risk and complexity. HRQoL was recorded using the 
validated EuroQol five dimensions five levels (EQ-5D-5L) instrument at baseline 
and 12 months. Additionally, patients diagnosed with osteoarthritis also 
reported HRQoL using short versions of Knee and/or Hip disability and 
osteoarthritis outcome scores (KOOSjr and HOOSjr). A case-series study design 
with repeated measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to assess 
changes in mean differences of EQ-5D index scores after controlling for baseline 
covariates. Additionally, backward stepwise multivariable linear regression 
models were conducted to determine significant predictors of EQ-5D index scores 
at follow-up.
RESULTS: Out of 616 patients, 417 (68%) reported EQ-5D scores at follow-up. 
Almost half (48%) of the WellNet patients reported improved EQ-5D index scores 
at follow-up. After controlling for baseline covariates, the adjusted mean 
difference was statistically significant whilst also meeting the bare minimal 
clinically important difference (MCID) with a change of 0.03 (95% CI 0.01, 
0.05). The multivariable regression models determined that baseline EQ-5D scores 
and positive diagnosis of a respiratory illness were significant predictors of 
HRQoL at follow-up. There were significant improvements across both KOOS and 
HOOS assessments, specifically, the pain and symptom scores in both scales met 
statistical significance in addition to meeting the MCID.
CONCLUSION: Patient-tailored chronic disease management (CDM) plans designed by 
team of GPs and CDM clinical coordinators could lead to better HRQoL among 
primary care patients.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Successful preventive treatment in chronic migraine 
(CM) remains an unmet need in some cases, and new therapeutic strategies are 
emerging. We aimed to test the effect of noninvasive, transcutaneous 
supraorbital nerve stimulation (tSNS) in a group of patients with CM.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was an open label, quasi-experimental design. 
Twenty-five CM patients were recruited from two hospital headache clinics. After 
a one-month baseline period, monthly visits were scheduled during three months. 
Headache occurrence, its intensity, and symptomatic medication intake were 
recorded through a diary kept by each patient. Both a per-protocol analysis and 
an intention-to-treat analysis were performed for the main outcome measures.
RESULTS: Twenty-one and 24 patients were included in the per-protocol and the 
intention-to-treat analyses, respectively. In the per-protocol analysis, a 
significant four-day decrease in the mean monthly days with moderate or severe 
headache was observed from baseline to the end of the study (t test, 
P = 0.0163), and there was a nonsignificant reduction of 2.95 in the mean 
monthly total headache days. In the intention-to-treat analysis, a 
nonsignificant 3.37 reduction in the mean monthly days with moderate or severe 
headache was observed for the same period, and there was a significant 2.75 
reduction in the mean monthly days with any headache (t test, P = 0.016).
CONCLUSIONS: tSNS could hold preventive properties in the treatment of CM, but 
the effect may be either mild or controversial. Double blind, sham-controlled 
studies are essential to confirm these findings and to outline their clinical 
relevance in the CM therapeutic scenario.

Chronic pain negatively affects psychological functioning 
including self-perception. Self-compassion may improve self-related functioning 
in patients with chronic pain but understanding of the neural mechanisms is 
limited. In this study, twenty patients with chronic low back pain read negative 
self-related situations and were instructed to be either self-reassuring or 
self-critical while undergoing fMRI. Patients rated their feelings of 
self-reassurance and self-criticism during each condition, and brain responses 
were contrasted with neutral instructions. Trait self-compassion measures (SCS) 
were also acquired. Brain activations during self-criticism and self-reassurance 
were localized to prefrontal, self- and emotion-processing areas, such as medial 
prefrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), dorsal anterior 
cingulate cortex and posterior cingulate cortex. Self-reassurance resulted in 
more widespread and stronger activations relative to self-criticism. Patients 
then completed a brief self-compassion training (8 contact hours, 2 weeks home 
practice). Exploratory pre-post comparisons in thirteen patients found that 
feelings of self-criticism were significantly reduced and brain activations were 
greater in the anterior insula and prefrontal cortical regions such 
as dlPFC. Pre-post increases in dlPFC activation correlated with increased 
self-compassion (SCS), suggesting that early self-compassion skills might 
primarily target self-criticism via dlPFC upregulation. 
Future controlled studies on self-compassion training in chronic 
pain populations should extend these results.

BACKGROUND: Loss of efficacy (LOE) is a well-known phenomenon associated with 
spinal cord stimulation (SCS) and is the leading cause of explant. Although 
recent advances in neuromodulation have resulted in a decreased incidence of 
LOE, it still occurs. Intuition suggests that when LOE ensues, switching to a 
different SCS therapy/platform could potentially be a viable clinical option; 
however, there are no data presently available to validate this theory.
OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of SCS therapy 
rotation with DeRidder Burst on reversing LOE. A subobjective was to evaluate 
the hypothesis that the body will treat a novel waveform as a "different 
therapy" when introduced for the first time, regardless of the setting.
STUDY DESIGN: Multicenter, retrospective.
SETTING: Private practice.
METHODS: A total of 307 patients with ongoing SCS therapy had a de novo therapy 
conversion to DeRidder Burst via surgical revision or software upgrade. Each 
cohort was split into 2 additional arms/subcohorts: those who were failing their 
SCS (salvage) versus those who were reporting success with their SCS system but 
were looking for increased pain relief (upgrade). This study was 
physician-directed and not commercially funded.
RESULTS: There were statistically significant reductions in Numeric Rating 
Scale, percent pain relief in both surgical revision and software upgrade arms. 
A statistical reduction in opioid dosing was seen in the overall population and 
the salvage group. Larger reductions in pain/opioid consumption were observed in 
the surgically revised group when the revision was performed earlier. Subgroup 
analysis showed both salvage and upgrade groups restored treatment efficacy 
irrespective of time or the previous frequency/waveform.
LIMITATIONS: The retrospective nature of the study and the inability to 
eliminate potential confounding variables when evaluating the use of opioids in 
the study population.
CONCLUSIONS: LOE is an unfortunate occurrence with few evidence-based solutions 
presently available to reverse it. Our findings suggest that implementing 
D-Burst stimulation may be an effective option for treating LOE, as well as 
potentially reducing opioid consumption, regardless of the prior SCS system.

Clinical effectiveness of caudal epidural pulsed radiofrequency stimulation in 
managing refractory chronic leg pain in patients with postlumbar surgery 
syndrome.

Chang MC, Lee DG.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the effect of caudal epidural pulsed 
radiofrequency stimulation in patients with chronic lumbosacral radicular pain 
due to postlumbar surgery syndrome who were unresponsive to at least two 
epidural steroid injections through the interlaminar, transforaminal, or caudal 
route.
METHODS: We recruited 25 patients with chronic persistent radicular pain in one 
or both legs (⩾ 4 on the Numeric Rating Scale [NRS]) despite spinal surgery. 
They were unresponsive to at least two epidural steroid injections. We 
retrospectively conducted this study. Electrode needles were placed into the 
epidural space (S2-3 intervertebral level) through the sacral hiatus, and pulsed 
radiofrequency stimulation was administered. The outcomes were evaluated using 
the NRS scores for radicular pain before treatment and 1-3 months after 
treatment. Successful pain relief was defined as a ⩾ 50% reduction in the scores 
at 3 months after treatment.
RESULTS: The pain scores changed significantly over time (p< 0.001): 
pretreatment, 4.9 ± 0.9; 1 month, 3.6 ± 1.4; 2 months, 3.8 ± 1.4; and 3 months, 
3.9 ± 1.4. At 1, 2, and 3 months after pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) procedure, 
the NRS scores were significantly reduced compared with the scores before the 
treatment. Eight patients (32%) reported successful pain relief at 3 months 
after treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Although only 32% of the patients with postlumbar surgery syndrome 
showed successful pain relief after treatment, the result is encouraging because 
we recruited only patients unresponsive to repeated epidural steroid injections.

BACKGROUND: Migraine is common and ranked as the first cause of disability in 
people under fifty. Despite significant advances in its pharmacological 
treatment, it often remains intractable. Neuromodulation is one option 
considered in the management of those patients.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and efficacy of neuromodulation in the treatment 
of intractable chronic migraine using the Abbott occipital nerve stimulator.
METHODS: Recruitment took place in 18 centres in 6 countries. Patients over the 
age of 18 who had failed three or more preventative drugs, had at least moderate 
disability based on MIDAS or HIT-6 score and were implanted with an Abbott 
neurostimulator were included in the study. Patients were followed up for a 
maximum of 24 months. Data were collected on adverse events, headache relief, 
headache days, quality of life, migraine disability, satisfaction and quality of 
life.
RESULTS: One hundred twelve patients were included, 79 female and 33 male, with 
45 patients reaching the maximum follow-up of 24 months. At 3 months, 33.7% were 
satisfied or very satisfied with the procedure with 43.0% reporting improved or 
greatly improved quality of life. 67.5% indicated that they would undergo the 
procedure again with satisfaction peaking at 9 months when 49.3% were satisfied 
or very satisfied with the procedure. At 24 months, 46.7% of available patients 
were satisfied or very satisfied with the procedure-18% of enrolled patients. 
The adverse events were however frequent with incidences of 37%, 47% and 31% 
respectively for hardware-, biological and stimulation-related side effects.
CONCLUSION: Neuromodulation can be beneficial for selected patients with 
intractable chronic migraine although frequent complications have been 
consistently reported across studies. Further research focusing on development 
of better hardware and technique optimisation and in particular reliable 
randomised trials with significantly longer follow-ups are warranted in this 
field.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness and 
safety between electroacupuncture (EA) combined with usual care (UC) and UC 
alone for pain reduction and functional improvement in patients with non-acute 
low back pain (LBP) after back surgery.
METHODS: In this multicentre, randomised, assessor-blinded active-controlled 
trial, 108 participants were equally randomised to either the EA with UC or the 
UC alone. Participants in the EA with UC group received EA treatment and UC 
treatment twice a week for 4 weeks; those allocated to the UC group received 
only UC. The primary outcome was the VAS pain intensity score. The secondary 
outcomes were functional improvement (Oswestry Disability Index [ODI]) and the 
quality of life (EuroQol-5-dimension questionnaire [EQ-5D]). The outcomes were 
measured at Week 5.
RESULTS: Significant reductions were observed in the VAS (mean difference [MD] 
-8.15; P=0.0311) and ODI scores (MD -3.98; P=0.0460) between two groups after 4 
weeks of treatment. No meaningful differences were found in the EQ-5D scores and 
incidence of adverse events (AEs) between the groups. The reported AEs did not 
have a causal relationship with EA treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that EA with UC treatment was more effective 
than UC alone and relatively safe in patients with non-acute LBP after back 
surgery. EA with UC treatment may be considered as an effective, integrated, 
conservative treatment for patients with non-acute LBP after back surgery.

BACKGROUND: In the pediatric population, complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) 
is a debilitating chronic pain syndrome that is classically treated with 
escalating polypharmacy and physical therapy. Failure of therapy is often 
encountered in both adult and pediatric patients with CRPS, after which invasive 
neuromodulatory therapy might be considered. Intrathecal drug delivery systems 
and spinal cord stimulation (SCS) have been reported in the literature as forms 
of neuromodulation effective in adult CRPS; however, SCS remains inadequately 
researched and underreported in the pediatric CRPS population. Owing to the 
differences in patient population characteristics and the specific vulnerability 
of adolescents to drugs that might be used to manage refractory cases, including 
but not limited to opioids, we believe that early effective pain management 
without the use of chronic pain medications is of paramount importance.
METHODS: Recent evidence suggests that neuromodulation can be useful toward 
improving function and managing pain, while also reducing medication use in 
chronic pain patients. A representative case a review of the literature is 
performed.
RESULTS: We report the effective treatment of CRPS in a pediatric patient 
following implantation of an SCS device typifying the improved pain scores, 
decreased medication use, and substantially improved functional abilities in 
pediatric patients following SCS.
CONCLUSIONS: The manuscript objective is to stimulate a discussion for SCS use 
earlier in the therapeutic management of CRPS in children.

Protein kinase type C-ε (PKCε) plays important roles in the sensitization of 
primary afferent nociceptors, such as ion channel phosphorylation, that in turn 
promotes mechanical hyperalgesia and pain chronification. In these neurons, PKCε 
is modulated through the local release of mediators by the surrounding Schwann 
cells (SCs). The progesterone metabolite allopregnanolone (ALLO) is endogenously 
synthesized by SCs, whereas it has proven to be a crucial mediator of 
neuron-glia interaction in peripheral nerve fibers. Biomolecular and 
pharmacological studies on rat primary SCs and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) 
neuronal cultures were aimed at investigating the hypothesis that ALLO modulates 
neuronal PKCε, playing a role in peripheral nociception. We found that SCs 
tonically release ALLO, which, in turn, autocrinally upregulated the synthesis 
of the growth factor brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Subsequently, 
glial BDNF paracrinally activates PKCε via trkB in DRG sensory neurons. Herein, 
we report a novel mechanism of SCs-neuron cross-talk in the peripheral nervous 
system, highlighting a key role of ALLO and BDNF in nociceptor sensitization. 
These findings emphasize promising targets for inhibiting the development and 
chronification of neuropathic pain.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to report the outcomes of sacral 
neuromodulation (SNM) in chronic pelvic pain (CPP) patients in the Finnish 
national cohort.
METHODS: This was a register-based retrospective study, involving all the 
centers that provide SNM treatment in Finland. The data of all patients treated 
with SNM for CPP were gathered from Oulu-, Turku-, Tampere- and Helsinki 
University Hospitals, as well as Jyväskylä and Seinäjoki Central Hospitals. All 
patients who had been tested for SNM implantation prior to April 2017 were 
included in the study.
RESULTS: A total of 51 patients were selected for SNM treatment due to CPP from 
2004 until 2017. The mean follow-up time was 13.8 months (SD 22.9 months). A 
total of 28 patients (57%) advanced from testing to permanent stimulator 
implantation. There were 21 patients (41%) who had a working modulator implanted 
at the end of follow-up. Patients with endometriosis-related pain had a 
significantly higher permanent implantation rate than the overall implantation 
rate (88% vs. 57%; p = 0.01). The endometriosis patients also had a higher 
overall success rate by the end of the follow-up (75% vs. 41%; p = 0.026) 
CONCLUSIONS: SNM may be a viable treatment option for patients with CPP due to 
endometriosis. Further research on SNM treatment for endometriosis patients with 
refractory CPP is needed.

BACKGROUND: Pain is still a common feature in all types of cancers including 
head and neck and thoracic cancer. Neuromodulatory techniques have gained 
popularity over opioids in recent times because of the risks associated with 
chronic opioid therapy. There are no clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of 
scrambler therapy (ST) for the management of pain due to head and neck and 
thoracic cancer.
OBJECTIVE: This trial was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of scrambler 
therapy (ST) for pain relief and to assess the possible effect of ST on the 
dosage of opioids in patients suffering from cancer pain.
STUDY DESIGN: A randomized control trial (RCT) was performed.
SETTING: The trial was conducted at the Pain and Palliative Care Unit of the Dr. 
B.R. Ambedkar Institute Rotary Cancer Hospital of All India Institute of Medical 
Sciences, New Delhi, India.
METHOD: Forty patients were included in each of the 2 arms, control and 
Intervention. In both arms, patients were given pain management drugs. In the 
intervention group, patients additionally received 10 consecutive sessions of ST 
with one follow-up after 7 days. A numeric rating scale (NRS-11) was used to 
measure pain. Drug dosage was also recorded.
RESULTS: Overall, pain decreased in both arms. However, pain decreased more in 
the intervention arm as compared to the control arm. The total change in the 
mean score of the NRS-11 from baseline to follow-up was 3.1 and 6.19 in the 
control and ST arms, respectively. Differences between pain scores in both arms 
became significant from day 3 onwards. Mean morphine dose was significantly 
lower in the intervention arm from day 7 onwards.
LIMITATIONS: The study followed the patients until one week after the last 
treatment session and encouraged patients to return for treatment if their pain 
returned to previous levels within 10 days. Moreover, patients in the control 
arm received the standard of care in the form of pharmacological treatment but 
did not receive either transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) or a 
sham (placebo) procedure.
CONCLUSIONS: The trial showed that ST is an effective treatment for the 
management of pain due to head and neck and thoracic cancer. On the basis of 
this study, the use of ST for the management of refractory cancer pain in head 
and neck and thoracic cancer is recommended.

INTRODUCTION: Spinal cord stimulation is becoming an increasingly used modality 
for the treatment of chronic pain. The Proclaim XR implantable pulse generator 
(IPG) is a novel device designed to supply low-dose BurstDR stimulation in a 
primary cell battery guaranteed to last 5-10 years with appropriate programming.
AREAS COVERED: BurstDR stimulation involves specifically delivered pockets of 
electrical energy coupled with a passive recharge mechanism to mimic the body's 
natural neuronal activity. MEDLINE databases were searched with a date range 
from 2010 to 2020, and a review of the evidence for low amplitude BurstDR 
stimulation, which led to FDA approval of the Proclaim XR system, is provided. 
In addition, we will review the safety and precautionary measures involved with 
this device.
EXPERT OPINION: The Proclaim XR IPG is the newest and most advanced device in 
SCS technology. It is designed to meet the preferences of patients by providing 
burst low amplitude intermittent dosing in a recharge-free manner and a 
guaranteed 5-10 year battery life.

OBJECTIVE: To quantify the relationship between the electrical power requirement 
to achieve pain relief and the position of the active electrode of dorsal root 
ganglion stimulators within the spinal nerve root exit foramen.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of 
92 consecutive patients undergoing dorsal root ganglion stimulation (DRGS) for 
chronic pain in a single center. Cervical and sacral cases, and failed 
trials/explanted DRGS were excluded, so we report on 57 patients with 78 
implanted leads. Anteroposterior and lateral fluoroscopic images of the lead in 
the exit foramen were examined, and the active electrode positions were put into 
categories depending on their location relative to fixed anatomical landmarks. 
The clinical outcome and the power requirements for each of these groups of 
electrodes were then analyzed. Overall pain outcome was assessed by numeric pain 
rating scale score pre-operatively and post-operatively.
RESULTS: There was no significant relationship between power requirements and 
mediolateral electrode position, although the lowest average was observed with 
electrode positions directly below the center of the pedicle. On lateral x-ray, 
the lowest power requirements were observed in the electrodes positioned 
superodorsally or dorsally within the foramen. Importantly, power requirements 
in this location were consistently low, while the power requirements in other 
locations were not only higher but also much more variable. Electrodes in the 
superodorsal position required a median output power almost four times lower 
than electrodes in other positions (p = 0.002). Clinical outcome was not 
significantly related to power requirement or foraminal position.
CONCLUSION: Aiming for a superodorsal electrode position on lateral 
intraoperative fluoroscopy is desirable, since siting leads in this location 
reduces the required stimulator output power very substantially and thus will 
extend battery life. Position within the foramen does not determine clinical 
outcome, and so the implanter can safely aim for the low power site without 
detriment to the analgesic efficacy of the system.

BACKGROUND: Chronic abdominal pain is a debilitating condition known for its 
multifactorial nature. Outcomes with spinal cord stimulation (SCS) for abdominal 
pain syndromes are noticeably absent in the literature. To date, there have been 
no published reports of novel waveforms of SCS for management of chronic 
abdominal pain. We assessed the efficacy and durability of BurstDR SCS in 
reducing abdominal pain and analgesic consumption.
CASE DESCRIPTION: We performed a retrospective review of medical records from 3 
patients with different etiologies of abdominal pain (postherniorrhaphy pain 
syndrome, Crohn disease, abdominal neuropathy). All patients underwent thoracic 
laminectomy for BurstDR SCS paddle lead and pulse generator placement after a 
successful trial stimulation period. Data were collected with a telephone survey 
after a minimum duration of >24 months following implantation. Pain scores were 
measured using a numeric rating scale. Two of 3 patients were entirely pain-free 
and reported Patient Global Impression of Change scores of 7 after a minimum 
follow-up of >24 months. While the third patient continued to have chronic as 
well as episodic abdominal pain, he was able to discontinue all narcotic pain 
medications and experienced a 33% decrease in frequency and 60% decrease in 
severity of monthly pain exacerbations. He reported satisfaction and a Patient 
Global Impression of Change of 6.
CONCLUSIONS: BurstDR SCS is a new programming modality, and long-term follow-up 
is necessary to determine its durability. Despite varying etiologies of 
abdominal pain, this series suggests BurstDR SCS sustained for >2 years might be 
effective as a treatment for abdominal pain syndromes. Future studies of SCS 
would benefit from standardized abdominal pain scores and high-powered studies 
using global patient registries.

OBJECTIVE: Invasive motor cortex stimulation (iMCS) has been proposed as a 
treatment for intractable neuropathic pain syndromes. Although the mechanisms 
underlying the analgesic effect of iMCS remain largely elusive, several studies 
found iMCS-related changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in neuropathic 
pain patients. The aim of this study was to meta-analyze the findings of 
neuroimaging studies on rCBF changes to iMCS.
METHODS: PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library were 
systematically searched for retrieval of relevant scientific papers. After 
initial assessment of relevancy by screening title and abstract by two 
investigators, independently, predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria were 
used for final inclusion of papers. Descriptive results were statistically 
assessed, whereas coordinates were pooled and meta-analyzed in accordance with 
the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) methodology.
RESULTS: Six studies were included in the systematic narrative analysis, 
suggesting rCBF increases in the cingulate gyrus, thalamus, insula, and putamen 
after switching the MCS device "ON" as compared to the "OFF" situation. 
Decreases in rCBF were found in for example the precentral gyrus and different 
occipital regions. Two studies did not report stereotactic coordinates and were 
excluded from further analysis. ALE meta-analysis showed that, after switching 
the iMCS electrode "ON," increased rCBF occurred in the (1) anterior cingulate 
gyrus; (2) putamen; (3) cerebral peduncle; (4) precentral gyrus; (5) superior 
frontal gyrus; (6) red nucleus; (7) internal part of the globus pallidus; (8) 
ventral lateral nucleus of the thalamus; (9) medial frontal gyrus; (10) inferior 
frontal gyrus; and (11) claustrum, as compared to the "OFF" situation. 
Reductions in rCBF were found in the posterior cingulate gyrus when the iMCS 
electrode was turned "OFF."
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggested that iMCS induces changes in principal 
components of the default mode-, the salience-, and sensorimotor network.

The voltage sodium channel 1.8 (NaV1.8) in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) 
neurons contributes to the initiation and development of chronic inflammatory 
and neuropathic pain. However, an effective intervention on NaV1.8 remains to be 
studied in pre-clinical research and clinical trials. In this study, we aimed to 
investigate whether transcription factor 4 (TCF4) overexpression represses 
NaV1.8 expression in DRG neurons, thus preventing the development of chronic 
pain. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP), we verified the interaction of 
TCF4 and sodium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit 10A (SCN10A) enhancer in 
HEK293 cells and rat DRG neurons. Using a dual luciferase reporter assay, we 
confirmed the transcriptional inhibition of TCF4 on SCN10A promoter in vitro. To 
investigate the regulation of TCF4 on Nav1.8, we then upregulated TCF4 
expression by intrathecally delivering an overexpression of recombinant 
adeno-associated virus (rAAV) in the Complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced 
inflammatory pain model and spared nerve injury (SNI)-induced neuropathic pain 
model. By using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), western blot, 
and immunostaining, we evaluated NaV1.8 expression after a noxious stimulation 
and the application of the TCF4 overexpression virus. We showed that the 
intrathecal delivery of TCF4 overexpression virus significantly repressed the 
increase of NaV1.8 and prevented the development of hyperalgesia in rats. 
Moreover, we confirmed the efficient role of an overexpressed TCF4 in preventing 
the CFA- and SNI-induced neuronal hyperexcitability by calcium imaging. Our 
results suggest that attenuating the dysregulation of NaV1.8 by targeting TCF4 
may be a novel therapeutic strategy for chronic inflammatory and neuropathic 
pain.

Introduction: Although the clinical use of electro-acupuncture is widespread, 
the neuromodulating influence of various applied frequencies is not well 
established. Objectives: Heart rate variability (HRV), stress and 
parasympathetic recovery are closely related to health, longevity and vitality 
in humans. This study was undertaken to determine the influence of different 
electro-therapy frequencies on various autonomic nervous system markers when 
applied to a Battlefield Acupuncture Protocol (BFA). Design: A detailed 
comparison of autonomic nervous system (ANS) response to low frequency (LF) 
2.5 Hz electro-acupuncture and mid-frequency (MF) 15 Hz electro-acupuncture 
applied by point stimulation to acupuncture points was undertaken on 2 groups of 
12 patients. Interventions: Both LFEA and MFEA were applied to Battlefield 
Acupuncture protocol, consisting of five (5) key acupuncture ear (auricular) 
points that isolate the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and central nervous 
system's role in the chronic/acute pain cycle. Evaluations entailed an advanced 
status of autonomic nervous system (ANS) function through Electro-Cardiogram 
(ECG) baseline markers reflecting: sympathetic stress (SI); parasympathetic 
vagal tone (high frequency [HF]) and heart rate variability (HRV = total power). 
All were repeated subsequent to electro-therapy using 2 separate 
electro-modalities of low-frequency (2.5 Hz) electro-acupuncture (LFEA) and 
Mid-Frequency (15 Hz) electro-acupuncture (MFEA). All 24 patients received one 
(1) elector-acupuncture session. Results: The autonomic nervous system response 
to LFEA (2.5 Hz) reflected a statistically significant pre-post improvement in 
three of the markers collected: heart rate variability (HRV) improved by 61% 
[p = 0.002]; sympathetic stress (SI) reduced 42% [p = 0.002]; and 
parasympathetic vagal tone (HF) increased 56% [p = 0.017]. In contrast, MFEA 
(15 Hz) showed positive but non-significant changes in outcomes in all nervous 
system markers. Conclusions: The autonomic nervous system response with LFEA 
showed a measurable reduction in sympathetic stress with subsequent improvement 
in vagal tone, and HRV. This positive sympathetic nervous system deactivation 
from LFEA application shown in this study could have a major impact on other 
pathologies related to human health and longevity. Further cohort studies are 
warranted to determine the validity of these outcomes.

Despite conservative and surgical treatments, patients with neurogenic thoracic 
outlet syndrome can develop debilitating chronic pain of the shoulder and arm. 
Here we report a case of a patient who failed medical treatment, surgical 
resection of the first rib, and subsequent resection of rib regrowth with 
partial excision of a hypertrophied middle scalene muscle. Ultimately, this 
patient was successfully treated with spinal cord stimulation with dramatic pain 
relief and remarkable functional improvement for more than 3 years. This first 
report provides hope for those who suffer from this debilitating syndrome.

Introduction: As an alternative to those patients who cannot be performed an 
awake spinal cord stimulation (SCS) or had been percutaneously implanted with 
poor pain relief outcomes, neurophysiological monitoring through transcranial 
motor evoked potentials (MEPs), somatosensory-evoked potentials (SSEPs) and 
free-run electromyography (EMG) under general anesthesia allows the correct 
placement of surgical leads and provide objective responses.Methods: An initial 
series of 15 patients undergoing SCS implantation for chronic pain. Physiologic 
midline was determined with 32-channel NIM-Eclipse System equipment. During 
neurophysiological monitoring, MEPs, SSEPs, EMG and CMAPs were recorded.Results: 
MEPs, SSEPs, and EMG were able to target spinal cord physiological midline 
during SCS to all patients. Physiologic midline was deviated in 53% patients. No 
warning events in SSEPs, MEPs, or EMG were recorded in any patient.Conclusions: 
Bilateral CMAPs recording allows placement of paddle leads in physiological 
midline, obtaining an accurate coverage, pain relief and avoid unpleasant or 
ineffective stimulation postoperatively. While these neurophysiological 
techniques are generally used to provide information on the state of the nervous 
system and prevent neurological injury risks during SCS, our work has shown that 
can accurate direct lead placement.

BACKGROUND: Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation over the primary 
cortex has been shown to activate regions of the brain involved in the 
descending modulation of pain sensitivity. However, more research is required to 
dissect the spinal cord analgesic mechanisms associated with the development of 
central sensitization.
METHODS: In this randomized, double blind, crossover study 12 healthy 
participants had baseline mechanical stimulus response (S/R) functions measured 
before and after the development of capsaicin-induced ongoing pain sensitivity. 
The effects of 20 min of either real or sham transcranial direct current 
stimulation (tDCS, 2 mA) over the primary motor cortex on dynamic mechanical 
allodynia (DMA) and mechanical pain sensitivity (MPS) were then investigated.
RESULTS: Topical application of capsaicin resulted in an increase in area under 
the pain ratings curve for both DMA (p < .01) and MPS (p < .01). The effects of 
tDCS on the area under the curve ratio (i.e. post-/pre-treatment) revealed 
significant analgesic effects over DMA (p < .05) and MPS (p < .05) when compared 
with sham.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that anodal tDCS over the primary motor 
cortex can reduce both dynamic and static forms of mechanical pain sensitivity 
associated with the development of DMA and MPS, respectively. The use of tDCS 
may provide a novel mechanism-driven therapy in chronic pain patients with 
altered mechanical S/R functions.
SIGNIFICANCE: This research shows new evidence that anodal tDCS over the primary 
motor cortex can reduce dynamic and static forms of mechanical pain sensitivity 
in the capsaicin model of ongoing pain. By using this approach, it may be 
possible to provide mechanism-driven analgesia in chronic pain patients who have 
dynamic mechanical allodynia and/or secondary mechanical hyperalgesia.

Although degenerative disc disease (DDD) and related low back pain (LBP) are 
growing public health problems, the underlying disease mechanisms remain 
unclear. An increase in the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels in 
DDD has been reported. This study aimed to examine the role of VEGF receptors 
(VEGFRs) in DDD, using a mouse model of DDD. Progressive DDD was induced by 
anterior stabbing of lumbar intervertebral discs in wild type (WT) and VEGFR-1 
tyrosine-kinase deficient mice (vegfr-1TK-/- ). Pain assessments were performed 
weekly for 12 weeks. Histological and immunohistochemical assessments were made 
for discs, dorsal root ganglions, and spinal cord. Both vegfr-1TK-/- and WT mice 
presented with similar pathological changes in discs with an increased 
expression of inflammatory cytokines and matrix-degrading enzymes. Despite the 
similar pathological patterns, vegfr-1TK-/- mice showed insensitivity to pain 
compared with WT mice. This insensitivity to discogenic pain was related to 
lower levels of pain factors in the discs and peripheral sensory neurons and 
lower spinal glial activation in the vegfr-1TK- /- mice than in the WT mice. 
Exogenous stimulation of bovine disc cells with VEGF increased inflammatory and 
cartilage degrading enzyme. Silencing vegfr-1 by small-interfering-RNA decreased 
VEGF-induced expression of pain markers, while silencing vegfr-2 decreased 
VEGF-induced expression of inflammatory and metabolic markers without changing 
pain markers. This suggests the involvement of VEGFR-1 signaling specifically in 
pain transmission. Collectively, our results indicate that the VEGF signaling is 
involved in DDD. Particularly, VEGFR-1 is critical for discogenic LBP 
transmission independent of the degree of disc pathology.

Voltage-gated T-type Ca2+ (CaV3) channels regulate diverse physiological events, 
including neuronal excitability, and have been linked to several pathological 
conditions such as absence epilepsy, cardiovascular diseases, and neuropathic 
pain. It is also acknowledged that calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 
II and protein kinases A and C regulate the activity of T-type channels. 
Interestingly, peripheral nerve injury induces tactile allodynia and upregulates 
CaV3.2 channels and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) in dorsal root ganglia 
(DRG) and spinal dorsal horn. Here, we report that recombinant CaV3.2 channels 
expressed in HEK293 cells are regulatory targets of Cdk5. Site-directed 
mutagenesis showed that the relevant sites for this regulation are residues S561 
and S1987. We also found that Cdk5 may regulate CaV3.2 channel functional 
expression in rats with mechanical allodynia induced by spinal nerve ligation 
(SNL). Consequently, the Cdk5 inhibitor olomoucine affected the compound action 
potential recorded in the spinal nerves, as well as the paw withdrawal 
threshold. Likewise, Cdk5 expression was upregulated after SNL in the DRG. These 
findings unveil a novel mechanism for how phosphorylation may regulate CaV3.2 
channels and suggest that increased channel activity by Cdk5-mediated 
phosphorylation after SNL contributes nerve injury-induced tactile 
allodynia.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Neuropathic pain is a current public health 
challenge. It can develop as a result of injury or nerve illness. It is 
acknowledged that the expression of various ion channels can be altered in 
neuropathic pain, including T-type Ca2+ channels that are expressed in sensory 
neurons, where they play a role in the regulation of cellular excitability. The 
present work shows that the exacerbated expression of Cdk5 in a preclinical 
model of neuropathic pain increases the functional expression of CaV3.2 
channels. This finding is relevant for the understanding of the molecular 
pathophysiology of the disease. Additionally, this work may have a substantial 
translational impact, since it describes a novel molecular pathway that could 
represent an interesting therapeutic alternative for neuropathic pain.

INTRODUCTION: Nociceptive signals from lumbar intervertebral discs ascend in the 
sympathetic chain via the L2 dorsal root ganglion (L2 DRG), a potential target 
for discogenic low back pain in neuromodulation. Positron Emission 
Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET-CT) measures functional changes in the brain 
metabolic activity, identified by the changes in the regional cerebral blood 
flow (rCBF) as determined by the changes of F-18 Fluoro-deoxyglucose (18 F FDG) 
tracer within brain tissues.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Nine patients were recruited to explore the changes in 
PET-CT imaging at baseline and four-weeks post implantation of bilateral L2 DRG 
neurostimulation leads and implantable pulse generator (IPG). PET-CT scans were 
performed 30 min following an IV injection of 250±10% MBq of 18 F FDG tracer. 
Fifteen frames were acquired in 15 min. PET list-mode raw data were 
reconstructed and normalized appropriately to a brain anatomical atlas.
RESULTS: Nine patients were recruited to the study, where PET-CT imaging data 
for five patients were analyzed. The right and left insular cortex, primary and 
secondary somato-sensory cortices, prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, 
thalamus, amygdala, hippocampus and the midline periaqueductal areas, were 
assessed for any changes in the metabolic activity. A total of 85 pain matrix 
regions were delineated SUV (standardized uptake value)MAX , SUV MEAN  ± SD, and 
SUVPEAK were calculated for each of these regions of the brain and were compared 
pre- and post-L2 DRG stimulation. Sixty-one of the 85 matrices showed an 
increase in metabolic activity whereas 24 matrices showed a reduction in 
metabolic activity.
CONCLUSION: This is the first ever study reporting the changes in cerebral 
metabolic activity and multi-frame static brain 18 F FDG PET imaging after L2 
DRG stimulation for discogenic low back pain. Predominantly an increased 
metabolic activity in nociceptive brain matrices are seen with an increased in 
F18 F FDG uptake following L2 DRG stimulation.

BACKGROUND: Spinal cord stimulation for failed back surgery syndrome and chronic 
pain is a well-established treatment regimen today. Lead migration is the most 
common complication; mainly epidural caudal more than cranial electrode 
migration from the primary position is described repeatedly throughout the 
literature.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 60-year-old male patient with failed back surgery syndrome 
was eligible for spinal cord stimulation. Surgery had been performed 4 weeks 
before readmission with proper lead positioning of both electrodes in the 
midline of the epidural space. The electrode fixation mechanism at L2/3 had to 
be revised and was replaced with multiple ligature fixations due to the 
patient's slim build. He presented to our outpatient clinic with thoracic 
right-sided pain matching T5 with signs of overstimulation of the paravertebral 
muscles. X-ray imaging revealed cranial migration of 1 lead to T4 and a 
right-sided extraspinal migration of the other lead along a spinal nerve in T5 
exiting the neuroforamen and following beneath the corresponding rib dorsally. 
Revision surgery was performed using a thoracic paddle electrode.
CONCLUSIONS: Lead migration remains a challenge in spinal cord stimulation 
regardless of the fixation method. Rare unusual migration patterns in addition 
to simple caudal or cranial migration might pose a challenge for revision 
surgery and thus might reduce overall treatment efficacy.

BACKGROUND: Pharmacologic treatment is not successful in all cases of 
postmastectomy pain syndrome (PMPS). Some patients continue suffering pain while 
taking their medications, and others cannot tolerate the side effects of 
antineuropathic analgesics. Radiofrequency technology has provided promising 
results in the management of chronic neuropathic pain.
OBJECTIVES: Considering that affection of intercostobrachial nerves are the main 
reason behind PMPS, we aimed to evaluate and compare the analgesic efficacy of 
pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) when delivered either on thoracic dorsal root 
ganglion (DRG) of intercostobrachial nerves (thoracic DRG 2, 3, and 4) or their 
corresponding thoracic paravertebral nerves (PVNs).
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective randomized-controlled clinical trial.
SETTINGS: Interventional pain unit, tertiary center, university hospital.
METHODS: Sixty-four patients complaining of PMPS were randomized to either group 
DRG (n = 32) that received PRF on thoracic DRG, or group PVN (n = 32) that 
received PRF on thoracic PVN. The outcome variables were that the patients 
showed > 50% reduction in their visual analog scale (VAS) pain score; the VAS 
pain score and global perceived effect (GPE) was evaluated during a 6-month 
follow-up period.
RESULTS: The percentage of patients who showed > 50% reduction of their VAS pain 
score was significantly higher in group DRG compared with group PVN, assessed at 
4 and 6 months postprocedure (23/29:79.3% vs. 13/29:44.8%; P = 0.007) and 
(22/29:75.9% vs. 7/29:24.1%; P < 0.001), respectively, however, the 2 groups did 
not significantly differ at 1, 2, and 3 months postprocedure (DRG vs. PVN), 
(21/29: 72.4% vs. 21/29: 72.4%; P = 0.542), (24/29: 82.8% vs. 23/29: 79.9%; P = 
0.778), and (24/29: 82.8% vs. 19/29: 65.5%; P = 0.136), respectively. There was 
a statistically significant reduction of VAS pain score at 4 and 6 months (DRG 
vs. PVN, mean ± standard deviation, 2.9 ± 2 vs. 3.9 ± 1.5; mean difference (95% 
confidence interval), 1 (0.06:1.9); P = 0.038; 3 ± 1.94 vs. 5.1 ± 1.5; mean 
difference (95% confidence interval), 1.9 (1:2.9); P < 0.001, respectively), 
however, the 2 groups did not significantly differ at 1, 2, and 3 months 
postprocedure. With regard to the patient's satisfaction (i.e., GPE), assessed 
at 3 and 6 months postprocedure, there was a significantly higher satisfaction 
in group DRG compared with group PVN (median [interquartile range (IQR)], 6 
(5:7) vs. 3 (2:4);P < 0.001), however, the patient's satisfaction was similar 
between groups at 3 months postprocedure: median (IQR), 6 (4:7) vs. 6 (5:6); P = 
0.327.
LIMITATIONS: The study follow-up period is limited to 6 months only.
CONCLUSIONS: PRF of both the thoracic DRG and the thoracic PVN are effective 
treatments for PMPS; however, PRF of DRG provided a better long-term analgesic 
effect. Nevertheless, given the inherent risk of performing thoracic foraminal 
interventions and the technical difficulty of targeting thoracic DRG, we 
recommend that PRF of DRG should be reserved for cases that failed to gain 
adequate response to PRF of thoracic PVN in conjunction with medical treatment.

Restoring somatosensory feedback to people with limb amputations is crucial to 
improve prosthetic control. Multiple studies have demonstrated that peripheral 
nerve stimulation and targeted reinnervation can provide somatotopically 
relevant sensory feedback. While effective, the surgical procedures required for 
these techniques remain a major barrier to translatability. Here, we demonstrate 
in four people with upper-limb amputation that epidural spinal cord stimulation 
(SCS), a common clinical technique to treat pain, evoked somatosensory percepts 
that were perceived as emanating from the missing arm and hand. Over up to 29 
days, stimulation evoked sensory percepts in consistent locations in the missing 
hand regardless of time since amputation or level of amputation. Evoked 
sensations were occasionally described as naturalistic (e.g. touch or pressure), 
but were often paresthesias. Increasing stimulus amplitude increased the 
perceived intensity linearly, without increasing area of the sensations. These 
results demonstrate the potential of SCS as a tool to restore somatosensation 
after amputations.

Plain Language Summary: Even some of the most advanced prosthetic arms lack an 
important feature: the ability to relay information about touch or pressure to 
the wearer. In fact, many people prefer to use simpler prostheses whose cables 
and harnesses pass on information about tension. However, recent studies suggest 
that electrical stimulation might give prosthesis users more sensation and 
better control. After an amputation, the nerves that used to deliver sensory 
information from the hand still exist above the injury. Stimulating these nerves 
can help to recreate sensations in the missing limb and improve the control of 
the prosthesis. Still, this stimulation requires complicated surgical 
interventions to implant electrodes in or around the nerves. Spinal cord 
stimulation – a technique where a small electrical device is inserted near the 
spinal cord to stimulate nerves – may be an easier alternative. This approach 
only requires a simple outpatient procedure, and it is routinely used to treat 
chronic pain conditions. Now, Chandrasekaran, Nanivadekar et al. show that 
spinal cord stimulation can produce the feeling of sensations in a person’s 
missing hand or arm. In the experiments, four people who had an arm amputation 
underwent spinal cord stimulation over 29 days. During the stimulation, the 
participants reported feeling electrical buzzing, vibration, or pressure in 
their missing limb. Changing the strength of the electric signals delivered to 
the spinal cord altered the intensity of these sensations. The experiments are a 
step toward developing better prosthetics that restore some sensation. Further 
studies are now needed to determine whether spinal cord stimulation would allow 
people to perform sensory tasks with a prosthetic, for example handling an 
object that they cannot see.

Background: Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) has devastating consequences. Dorsal 
root ganglion as a pivotal locus participates in the process of neuropathic pain 
and nerve regeneration. In recent years, gene sequencing technology has seen 
rapid rise in the biomedicine field. So, we attempt to gain insight into in the 
mechanism of neuropathic pain and nerve regeneration in the transcriptional 
level and to explore novel genes through bioinformatics analysis. Methods: The 
gene expression profiles of GSE96051 were downloaded from GEO database. The gene 
ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway (KEGG) 
enrichment analyses were performed, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) 
network of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was constructed by 
Cytoscape software. Results: Our results showed that both IL-6 and Jun genes and 
the signaling pathway of MAPK, apoptosis, P53 present their vital modulatory 
role in nerve regeneration and neuropathic pain. Noteworthy, 13 hub genes 
associated with neuropathic pain and nerve regeneration, including Ccl12, 
Ppp1r15a, Cdkn1a, Atf3, Nts, Dusp1, Ccl7, Csf, Gadd45a, Serpine1, Timp1 were 
rarely reported in PubMed database, these genes may provide us the new 
orientation in experimental research and clinical study. Conclusions: Our 
results may provide more deep insight into the mechanism and a promising 
therapeutic target. The next step is to put our emphasis on an experiment level 
and to verify the novel genes from 13 hub genes.

OBJECTIVES: Dorsal root ganglion (DRG) stimulation has been demonstrated to be 
effective in treating painful diabetic polyneuropathy in a small case series. 
However, diabetic polyneuropathy only accounts for 41% of all polyneuropathies 
and the efficacy of DRG on other types of polyneuropathy is unclear. The 
objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of DRG stimulation in 
treating painful hereditary and idiopathic axonal polyneuropathy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a monocentric retrospective case series. Two 
subjects with painful hereditary axonal polyneuropathy and two subjects with 
painful chronic idiopathic axonal polyneuropathy who underwent DRG stimulation 
trials were included in this study. All subjects were evaluated independently by 
neuromuscular neurologists with eletrophysiological studies and genetic testing. 
Permanent DRG stimulator was implanted if significant pain relief (>50%) was 
achieved over the trial period. Pain level were evaluated at baseline, during 
the trial, after the permanent implantation and at one, three, and six months.
RESULTS: Pain was significantly reduced after the DRG stimulator trial with an 
average VAS reduction of 6.00 ± 2.83, or 65 ± 26.77% (p = 0.024). Three subjects 
subsequently underwent permanent DRG stimulator implantation. Pain remained 
significantly reduced after the permanent implantation. The average VAS 
reduction was 6.33 ± 2.31, or 67.5 ± 20.46% after permanent DRG implantation (p 
= 0.042), 7.67 ± 2.31, or 80.83 ± 15.88% at one month (p = 0.029), and 7.00 ± 
2.00 or 74.17 ± 14.21% at three and six months (p = 0.026). No complications 
were observed.
CONCLUSION: This small retrospective study suggests that DRG stimulation may be 
a safe and effective treatment for painful hereditary and idiopathic axonal 
polyneuropathy.

RATIONALE: Treatment of chronic neuropathic pain in the head and face regions 
presents a challenge for pain specialists due to the lack of reliable medical 
and surgical approaches.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 62-year-old patient came to our attention for an intense 
facial pain secondary to a lesion of the right trigeminal nerve (all branches) 
due to a petroclival meningioma.
DIAGNOSES: The patient also presented with gait impairment as well as a deficit 
of the right facial, auditory, trochlear and abducens cranial nerves.
INTERVENTIONS: Conventional medical management (CMM) as well as tonic SCS were 
already adopted but they all dramatically failed. We intervened with the use of 
high-frequency (10 kHz) spinal cord stimulation (HFSCS) at the cervicomedullary 
junction (CMJ). The patient was thus provided with HFSCS at the CMJ. Pain and 
quality of life (QoL) were assessed 1 and 3 months after implantation. We also 
tested the trigeminal-facial reflex responses.
OUTCOMES: HFSCS led to a full relief from the debilitating electric shocks like 
pain in the right hemiface, even though a background dull pain appeared. The 
gradual addition of pregabalin helped in fully relieving the painful 
symptomatology, with a significant improvement in QoL. Moreover, sensitivity 
amelioration on the inner portion of the mouth allowed the patient to start 
feeding again also using that side of the mouth. These findings were paralleled 
by a significant reshape of trigeminal-facial reflex responses suggesting an 
inhibition of nociceptive sensory inputs at brainstem level following HFSCS.
LESSONS: This is the first report suggesting the usefulness of HFSCS at the CMJ 
in neuropathic pain due to trigeminal nerve neuropathy non-responsive to tonic 
SCS and CMM.

Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has been considered as an alternative therapy to 
reduce opioid requirements in certain chronic pain disorders. However, 
information on long-term opioid consumption patterns and their impact on SCS 
device explantation is lacking. We conducted a retrospective study of 45 
patients to characterize long-term patterns of opioid usage after SCS 
implantation. Daily morphine equivalent dosage (MED) increased, decreased, and 
remained the same in 40%, 40%, and 20% of patients at 1-year follow-up, 
respectively. Twelve (27%) underwent explantation due to treatment failure at a 
median of 18 months after implantation. Pre-operative opioid status (naïve vs. 
active use) was not associated with explantation (18% vs. 29%, p = 0.699) and 
neither was the daily MED change status (i.e. increased, decreased, unchanged) 
at 1-year (p = 0.499, 1.000, 0.735, respectively). Following explantation, 
reduction in the daily MED was seen in 92% of patients with dosages falling 
below pre-operative baseline in nine. Among the opioid naïve patients, 55% were 
on opioids at last follow-up (average 32.4 ± 14.6 months). Our results indicate 
that daily opioid consumption does not decrease in most patients 1-year after 
SCS implantation. Furthermore, post-operative evaluation beyond 1-year is 
necessary to assess the efficacy and durability of SCS therapy as well as its 
impact on opioid requirement. Lastly, rigorous patient selection and 
pre-operative risk assessment for misuse and dependence are paramount to 
improving outcome after SCS implantation.

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a regional neuropathic pain syndrome. 
Excruciating pain often interferes with patients' ability to function normally. 
Spinal cord stimulators (SCS) have been effective in treating pain along with 
signs of sympathetic overactivity in patients with CRPS. Implantation of SCS is 
a high-risk interventional procedure with the potential for serious bleeding and 
neurological consequences in the spine. Meticulous evaluation and careful 
optimization are needed in patients with bleeding disorders.

INTRODUCTION: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and spinal cord stimulation (SCS) 
are 2 common modalities used in management of various pain conditions. RFA 
generates heat and an electromagnetic field that can theoretically interfere 
with the functionality and longevity of the SCS device. This is problematic for 
patients who need RFA and have previously undergone implantation of an SCS 
device.
CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case highlighting the safe use of bipolar RFA in 
a patient who had previously undergone implantation of a cervical SCS device.
DISCUSSION: We also present device-specific industry guidelines and 
recommendations for performing RFA in patients following SCS device 
implantation.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether training with a brain-computer interface (BCI) 
to control an image of a phantom hand, which moves based on cortical currents 
estimated from magnetoencephalographic signals, reduces phantom limb pain.
METHODS: Twelve patients with chronic phantom limb pain of the upper limb due to 
amputation or brachial plexus root avulsion participated in a randomized 
single-blinded crossover trial. Patients were trained to move the virtual hand 
image controlled by the BCI with a real decoder, which was constructed to 
classify intact hand movements from motor cortical currents, by moving their 
phantom hands for 3 days ("real training"). Pain was evaluated using a visual 
analogue scale (VAS) before and after training, and at follow-up for an 
additional 16 days. As a control, patients engaged in the training with the same 
hand image controlled by randomly changing values ("random training"). The 2 
trainings were randomly assigned to the patients. This trial is registered at 
UMIN-CTR (UMIN000013608).
RESULTS: VAS at day 4 was significantly reduced from the baseline after real 
training (mean [SD], 45.3 [24.2]-30.9 [20.6], 1/100 mm; p = 0.009 < 0.025), but 
not after random training (p = 0.047 > 0.025). Compared to VAS at day 1, VAS at 
days 4 and 8 was significantly reduced by 32% and 36%, respectively, after real 
training and was significantly lower than VAS after random training (p < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Three-day training to move the hand images controlled by BCI 
significantly reduced pain for 1 week.
CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that BCI 
reduces phantom limb pain.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Studies have reported relief of chronic shoulder pain 
with non-ablative pulsed neuromodulatory (pRF) or ablative radiofrequency (aRF) 
procedures on innervation of the shoulder joint but interpretation of these 
reports is hampered by inconsistent indications, anatomic targets and follow-up. 
This systematic review was conducted to synthesize the existing literature on 
procedures employing pRF or aRF for treating chronic shoulder pain.
DATABASES AND DATA TREATMENT: MEDLINE and other medical literature databases 
were reviewed up to 31 December 2019 for publications on pRF or aRF procedures 
on shoulder joint innervation to relieve chronic pain. Data on analgesic and 
functional outcomes measured at any time point following the interventions were 
extracted. Existing knowledge on innervation of the shoulder joint with 
relevance to RF procedures was also synthesized.
RESULTS: In all, 42 publications, 7 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 35 
observational studies, case series or reports were identified. Thirty-six of 
these publications were on pRF procedure and 29 of these reported procedures 
exclusively targeting the suprascapular nerve. A meta-analysis of the seven RCTs 
evaluating pRF indicated no analgesic benefit or functional improvement with 
this treatment over conventional medical management. Case series and reports on 
aRF indicate a potential for analgesic benefit but the quality of this evidence 
was low.
CONCLUSIONS: RF treatments targeting the sensory innervation of the shoulder 
joint affected by degenerative conditions have the potential to reduce pain but 
the current evidence does not suggest analgesic or functional benefit (GRADE 
certainty of evidence-low). Studies of high methodological quality are required 
to further investigate the role of these interventions.
SIGNIFICANCE: This is a comprehensive review of literature on pulsed 
(non-ablative) and ablative radiofrequency (RF) procedures for chronic shoulder 
pain. The systematic review and meta-analysis of 7 trials found that pulsed RF 
for chronic shoulder pain provided similar analgesia and functional improvement 
as conservative medical management at three months after the procedures. The 
case series and reports on ablative RF for shoulder pain indicate possible 
analgesic benefit but their quality was low. This review highlights the need for 
studies of a high quality on ablative RF treatments for chronic shoulder pain.

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) can be a debilitating, persistent, and 
treatment-resistant pain condition. This report presents a case of severe CRPS 
affecting multiple limbs, resistant to standard treatment modalities. Treatment 
with spinal cord stimulation (SCS) had an initial good effect. Nevertheless, the 
CRPS continued to progress, eventually affecting all 4 extremities. A lead 
fracture resulted in a rapidly developing recurrence of CRPS in the patient's 
arm, necessitating amputation. SCS may be an effective modality for treatment of 
severe CRPS. However, mechanical problems should always be considered when an 
SCS-implanted patient experiences rapid symptom progression or abrupt cessation 
of stimulation.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the trial success rate 
between anatomic lead placement (AP) and paresthesia-mapped (PM) lead placement 
techniques for spinal cord stimulation (SCS) using a nonlinear burst stimulation 
pattern.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eligible patients with back and/or leg pain with a 
Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) score of ≥6 who had not undergone previous SCS were 
enrolled in the study. A total of 270 patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 
each treatment arm. In the AP group, one lead tip was placed at the mid-body of 
T8, and the other at the superior endplate of T9. In the PM group, physicians 
confirmed coverage of the patient's primary pain location. Trial success was a 
composite of the following: ≥50% patient-reported pain relief at the end of the 
minimum three-day trial period, physician's recommendation, and patient's 
interest in a permanent implant.
RESULTS: Trial success for AP vs. PM groups was equivalent to 84.4% and 82.3%, 
respectively. Physicians who performed both techniques preferred AP technique 
(70% vs. 30%). Procedure times for placement of two leads were 31% shorter in 
the AP group (p < 0.0001). Decrease in the mean NRS pain score was similar 
between groups (53.2%, AP group; 53.8%, PM group, p = 0.79). Trial success for 
patients who went on to an extended trial with tonic stimulation was 50% (5/10) 
vs. 79% (11/14) for AP group and PM group, respectively (p = 0.2). A total of 13 
adverse events were observed (4.5%), most commonly lead migrations and pain 
around implant site, with no difference between groups.
CONCLUSIONS: When using a nonlinear burst stimulation pattern, anatomic or PM 
lead placement technique may be used. Nonresponders to subthreshold stimulation 
had a higher conversion rate when a PM technique was used. AP resulted in 
shorter procedure times with a similar safety profile and was strongly preferred 
by trialing physicians.

BACKGROUND: Dorsal root ganglion stimulation (DRG-S) has emerged as a treatment 
for complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) of the lower extremities, and recent 
small studies are demonstrating its potential efficacy in pain syndromes that 
are traditionally considered nociceptive in nature, such as axial low back pain. 
While improvements in neuromodulation technology have been substantial over the 
past decade, with DRG-S systems patients occasionally require additional 
interventional pain treatments for treatment of pain from other sources. 
Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of medial branch nerves innervating the facet 
joints is an accepted therapy for pain arising from the facet joints.
METHODS: We describe 2 cases from the same practice where we observed similar 
phenomena while performing a 2-needle monopolar lumbar RFA in patients with a 
DRG-S system implanted with leads positioned bilaterally at the S1 DRGs.
RESULTS: Initiation of RFA resulted in motor activation and discomfort in an S1 
distribution in the legs in both individual cases.
CONCLUSIONS: RFA can interfere with implanted DRG-S systems, resulting in 
overstimulation with motor recruitment. Specific anatomical considerations and 
device settings that may prevent interference are discussed.

OBJECTIVE: The WHISPER randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluates safety and 
clinical effectiveness of subperception spinal cord stimulation (SCS) at ≤1.2 
kHz in subjects previously implanted with an SCS system for treatment of 
chronic, neuropathic pain.
METHODS: WHISPER is a prospective, multicenter RCT with a crossover design 
sponsored by Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA (ClinicalTrials.gov: 
NCT02314000). Eligible subjects were randomized (N = 140) to receive 
subperception or supraperception for three months and then crossed over to 
receive the alternative. Upon completion of crossover period, subjects who 
preferred subperception were followed up to one year. Overall pain, 
quality-of-life, and other outcomes were collected in the study. The primary 
endpoint was the overall pain responder rate (≥50% improvement from baseline) 
with no increase in medications. Secondary endpoints consisted of pain scores, 
physical disability, quality of life, and treatment preference.
RESULTS: The study met its primary endpoint and demonstrated noninferiority 
between supraperception and subperception in a prespecified cohort of 70 
randomized subjects (Interim Analysis). Thirty-nine percent of subjects with 
subperception settings and 29% with supraperception settings had a greater than 
or equal to 50% reduction in their overall pain scores with no increase in 
average daily medication at three-months post-activation as compared with 
baseline. Further assessment of all participating study subjects (N = 140) 
revealed similar results. Subjects were previously implanted 3.8 ± 2 years and 
had a disability score (Oswestry Disability Index) of 70.2 ± 11.4 at study 
start. Of the randomized subjects that completed the End of Period 2 Visit, 93 
(66%) preferred subperception SCS and their mean overall pain reduced from 7.3 ± 
1.1 (N = 89) at baseline to 4.0 ± 2.1 (N = 80) at 12-months post-activation. 
Post hoc analysis also demonstrated that multiple options provide superior 
outcomes, as supported by a 74% increase in the responder rate when subjects 
could choose their most effective option (47%) compared with supraperception 
alone (27%).
DISCUSSION: Subperception SCS at ≤1.2 kHz is safe and effective in subjects with 
extreme physical disability and previously implanted for chronic pain. Further, 
by providing study participants with different waveform options, increased pain 
relief was achieved.

BACKGROUND: The CGRP antagonists offer a novel therapeutic approach in migraine. 
Their utility in patients with severe forms of chronic migraine is a subject of 
particular interest. We present outcomes of 9 months of erenumab treatment in a 
cohort of patients with difficult-to-control chronic migraine, all of whom had 
prior unsatisfactory response to onabotulinumtoxinA.
METHODS: We offered erenumab to 98 patients with a prior unsatisfactory response 
to onabotulinumtoxinA. Eighty of 98 had trialled greater occipital nerve 
injections (82%), 32/98 peripheral neurostimulation (33%) and 18/98 intravenous 
dihydroergotamine (18%). Thirty eight of 98 (39%) met the definition of triptan 
overuse and 43/98 (44%) analgesic overuse. All patients met the EHF criteria for 
'resistant migraine'. Outcome measures (recorded monthly) included days with 
headache limiting activities of daily living ("red"), not limiting ("amber"), 
headache free ("green"), and requiring triptans or other analgesics. Quality of 
life scores - headache impact test 6 (HIT-6), patient health questionnaire 9 
(PHQ-9) and pain disability index (PDI) - were also measured.
RESULTS: Mean number of red days improved by - 6.4 days (SE 0.67, 95%CI - 7.7 to 
- 5.1, p=0.001) at 3 months; - 6.8 days (SE 0.96, 95%CI - 8.80 to - 4.9, 
p=0.001) at 6 months and - 6.5 days (SE 0.86, 95%CI - 8.3 to - 4.8, p=0.001) at 
9 months. Repeated measures ANOVA confirmed improvements in the number of red 
(p=0.001), green (p=0.001), triptan (p=0.001) and painkiller days (p=0.001) as 
well as scores of the HIT-6 (p=0.001), PHQ-9 (p=0.001), and PDI (p=0.001) across 
the duration of study.
CONCLUSION: We observed improvements in pain, medication use and quality of life 
in onabotulinumtoxinA-resistant chronic migraine patients following erenumab 
treatment.

Chronic nonspecific low back pain is a frequent clinical condition affecting the 
general population and influencing disability level and quality of life. We 
performed a single-blinded, randomized, and controlled study to compare the 
effectiveness of manual pressure release (MPR) and electrical neuromodulation 
(ENM) treatments in the management of chronic low back pain. There were 20 
patients with chronic low back pain randomly assigned to 6 treatment sessions 
with either technique. Both groups were treated for 2 days a week for 3 weeks. 
Myofascial trigger points (MTrPs) were identified and skin conductance, 
pressure-pain threshold, postural changes, and the Oswestry Disability Index 
were assessed before and after each treatment session, along with the 
protocol-end data compared against the baseline data in each group. We found an 
outstanding and about equal deactivation of MTrPs from pre- to post-treatment in 
both groups, reducing disability in patients with chronic low back pain. The 
study highlights the ENM as a reliable tool for the evaluation of MTrPs, given a 
high agreement with the MPR. The effect on the neuromuscular condition of 
treating the "key trigger points" found in this study advances the knowledge of 
medical rehabilitation.

Do Thoracic Spinal Deformities Affect Outcomes of Spinal Cord Stimulators: A 
Retrospective Chart Review.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to ascertain whether the presence of 
structural thoracic deformities affects outcomes of permanent SCS placement.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Neural modulation via spinal cord stimulators (SCSs) 
has become an accepted treatment option for various chronic pain syndromes. In 
most cases, the surgeon desires accurate midline positioning of the paddle lead, 
allowing for flexibility of unilateral or bilateral coverage of pain patterns. 
Structural spinal deformities (scoliosis or kyphosis) often result from coronal, 
sagittal, and rotatory deformity that can make midline placement more difficult.
METHODS: Between 2013 and 2017, two-hundred forty-one charts of patients who 
underwent permanent SCS placement at our suburban hospital were reviewed. 
Demographic information, numerical rating system (NRS) pain scores, Oswestry 
Disability Index (ODI) scores, and opioid medication usage were recorded at 
baseline and after permanent stimulator placement. Thoracic scoliosis and 
kyphosis angles were measured using spinal radiographs. The effect of each 
structural deformity on NRS, ODI, and narcotic medication usage changes from 
baseline was analyzed.
RESULTS: Overall, 100 patients were included in our cohort. Fifty-six patients 
had measured thoracic spinal deformities (38% with scoliosis, 31% with 
kyphosis). There was no significant difference in NRS scores, ODI scores, or 
narcotic usage change between patients with scoliosis and those without 
(P = 0.66, P = 0.57, P = 0.75) or patients with kyphosis and those without 
(P = 0.51, P = 0.31, P = 0.63). Bivariate linear regression analysis showed that 
scoliotic and kyphotic angles were not significant predictors of NRS (P = 0.39, 
P = 0.13), ODI (P = 0.45, P = 0.07), and opioid usage (P = 0.70, P = 0.90) 
change, with multivariate regression analyses confirming these findings.
CONCLUSION: SCSs can be effective options for treating lumbar back pain and 
radiculopathy. Our study suggests that the presence of mild structural 
deformities does not adversely affect outcomes of permanent SCS placement and as 
such should not preclude this population from benefiting from such 
therapies.Level of Evidence: 4.

OBJECTIVES: Primary Objective: The primary objective is to reduce initiation of 
mechanical ventilator dependency in patients with moderate to severe CoViD- 19. 
This will be measured as the difference between the control group and active 
group for subjects admitted to the hospital for CoViD-19. Secondary Objectives: 
• To evaluate cytokine trends / Prevent cytokine storms • To evaluate 
supplemental oxygen requirements • To decrease mortality of CoViD-19 patients • 
Delay onset of ventilation TRIAL DESIGN: The study is a single centre, 2-arm, 
prospective, randomized (ratio 1:1), controlled trial with parallel groups 
design to compare the reduction of respiratory distress in a CoViD-19 
population, using the intervention of the gammaCore®-Sapphire device plus 
standard of care (active) vs. standard of care alone (SoC) - the control group. 
The gammaCore® treatments will be used acutely and prophylactically. The active 
and control groups will be matched for disease and severity.

OBJECTIVE:  Headache disorders are frequently associated with epilepsy. Some 
neuromodulation techniques for refractory epilepsy have been reported to 
positively influence the associated chronic headache. However, the exact 
mechanism of action of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) and anterior thalamic 
nuclei-deep brain stimulation (ANT-DBS) on pain perception is unclear.
METHOD:  We report a structured assessment of pain perception in a patient who 
experienced headache relief after ANT-DBS for refractory focal epilepsy and 
compare it with pain perception of epilepsy patients with chronic headache who 
were treated with and without VNS.
RESULTS:  The pain-associated symptoms in the ANT-DBS case were on the Pain 
Anxiety Symptoms Scale (PASS-40) subscore "physiological anxiety" closer to the 
control collective, whereas in patients with VNS, this was more likely for the 
PASS-40 subscores "cognitive anxiety" or "escape and avoidance."
CONCLUSION:  ANT-DBS and VNS may influence epilepsy-associated chronic headache 
in different ways.

BACKGROUND: Although evidence-based psychological treatments for chronic pain 
(CP) have been demonstrated to be effective for a variety of outcomes, modest 
effects observed in recent reviews indicate scope for improvement. 
Self-compassion promotes a proactive attitude towards self-care and actively 
seeking relief from suffering. Consequently, more compassionate people 
experience better physical, psychological and interpersonal well-being.
METHODS: We conducted a single-blind, randomized, controlled trial to examine 
the effects of a Mindful Self-Compassion program (MSC) on relevant clinical 
outcomes in patients with CP. Patients were randomly assigned to one of the two 
intervention arms: MSC or cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT). The protocols of 
both intervention arms were standardized and consisted of a 150-min session once 
a week during 8 weeks formatted to groups of no more than 20 participants. The 
primary outcome was self-compassion, measured with the Self-Compassion Scale 
(SCS). The secondary outcomes were other pain-related scores, quality-of-life 
measures, and anxiety and depression scores.
RESULTS: In all, 62 and 61 patients were assigned to the MSC and CBT groups, 
respectively. The MSC intervention was more effective than CBT for 
self-compassion (average treatment effect [ATE] = 0.126, p < 0.05). The 
secondary outcomes, pain acceptance (ATE = 5.214, p < 0.01), pain interference 
(ATE = -0.393, p < 0.05), catastrophizing (ATE = -2.139, p < 0.10) and anxiety 
(ATE = -0.902, p < 0.05), were also favoured in the experimental arm (MSC). No 
serious adverse events were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Mindful Self-Compassion is an appropriate therapeutic approach for 
CP patients and may result in greater benefits on self-compassion and emotional 
well-being than CBT.
SIGNIFICANCE: This randomized controlled trial compares the novel intervention 
(MSC program) with the gold standard psychological intervention for CP (CBT). 
MSC improves the levels of self-compassion, a therapeutic target that is 
receiving attention since the last two decades, and it also improves anxiety 
symptoms, pain interference and pain acceptance more than what CBT does. These 
results provide empirical support to guide clinical work towards the promotion 
of self-compassion in psychotherapeutic interventions for people with CP.

BACKGROUND: Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is an effective method to treat 
neuropathic pain; however, it is challenging to compare different stimulation 
modalities in an individual patient, and thus, it is largely unknown which of 
the many available SCS modalities is most effective. Specifically, electrodes 
leading out through the skin would have to be consecutively connected to 
different, incompatible SCS devices and be tested over a time period of several 
weeks or even months. The risk of wound infections for such a study would be 
unacceptably high and blinding of the trial difficult. The PARS-trial seizes the 
capacity of a new type of wireless SCS device, which enables a blinded and 
systematic intra-patient comparison of different SCS modalities over extended 
time periods and without increasing wound infection rates.
METHODS: The PARS-trial is designed as a double-blinded, randomized, and 
placebo-controlled multi-center crossover study. It will compare the clinical 
effectiveness of the three most relevant SCS paradigms in individual patients. 
The trial will recruit 60 patients suffering from intractable neuropathic pain 
of the lower extremities, who have been considered for SCS therapy and were 
already implanted with a wireless SCS device prior to study participation. Over 
a time period of 35 days, patients will be treated consecutively with three 
different SCS paradigms ("burst," "1 kHz," and "1.499 kHz") and placebo 
stimulation. Each SCS paradigm will be applied for 5 days with a washout period 
of 70 h between stimulation cycles. The primary endpoint of the study is the 
level of pain self-assessment on the visual analogue scale after 5 days of SCS. 
Secondary, exploratory endpoints include self-assessment of pain quality (as 
determined by painDETECT questionnaire), quality of life (as determined by 
Quality of Life EQ-5D-5L questionnaire), anxiety perception (as determined by 
the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), and physical restriction (as 
determined by the Oswestry Disability Index).
DISCUSSION: Combining paresthesia-free SCS modalities with wireless SCS offers a 
unique opportunity for a blinded and systematic comparison of different SCS 
modalities in individual patients. This trial will advance our understanding of 
the clinical effectiveness of the most relevant SCS paradigms.

INTRODUCTION: Treatments for fecal incontinence (FI) remain unsatisfactory 
because they do not remedy the underlying multifactorial dysfunction(s) 
including anorectal neuropathy. The aim of this study was to investigate the 
optimal dose frequency, clinical effects, and safety of a novel treatment, 
translumbosacral neuromodulation therapy (TNT), aimed at improving neuropathy.
METHODS: Patients with FI were randomized to receive 6 sessions of weekly TNT 
treatments consisting of 600 repetitive magnetic stimulations over each of 2 
lumbar and 2 sacral sites with either 1, 5, or 15 Hz frequency. Stool diaries, 
FI severity indices, anorectal neurophysiology and sensorimotor function, and 
quality of life were compared. Primary outcome measure was the change in FI 
episodes/week. Responders were patients with ≥50% decrease in weekly FI 
episodes.
RESULTS: Thirty-three patients with FI participated. FI episodes decreased 
significantly (∆ ±95% confidence interval, 4.2 ± 2.8 (1 Hz); 2 ± 1.7 (5 Hz); 3.4 
± 2.5 (15 Hz); P < 0.02) in all 3 groups when compared with baseline. The 1 Hz 
group showed a significantly higher (P = 0.04) responder rate (91 ± 9.1%) when 
compared with the 5 Hz group (36 ± 18.2%) or 15 Hz (55 ± 18.2%); no difference 
was found between the 5 and 15 Hz groups (P = 0.667). Anal neuropathy, squeeze 
pressure, and rectal capacity improved significantly only in the 1 Hz (P < 0.05) 
group compared with baseline, but not in other groups. Quality of life domains 
improved significantly (P < 0.05) with 1 and 5 Hz groups. No device-related 
serious adverse events were noted.
DISCUSSION: TNT significantly improves FI symptoms in the short term, and the 1 
Hz frequency was overall better than 5 and 15 Hz. Both anorectal neuropathy and 
physiology significantly improved, demonstrating mechanistic improvement. TNT is 
a promising, novel, safe, efficacious, and noninvasive treatment for FI (see

BACKGROUND: Opioid use for chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) is complex. In the 
absence of pan-European guidance on this issue, a position paper was 
commissioned by the European Pain Federation (EFIC).
METHODS: The clinical practice recommendations were developed by eight 
scientific societies and one patient self-help organization under the 
coordination of EFIC. A systematic literature search in MEDLINE (up until 
January 2020) was performed. Two categories of guidance are given: 
Evidence-based recommendations (supported by evidence from systematic reviews of 
randomized controlled trials or of observational studies) and Good Clinical 
Practice (GCP) statements (supported either by indirect evidence or by 
case-series, case-control studies and clinical experience). The GRADE system was 
applied to move from evidence to recommendations. The recommendations and GCP 
statements were developed by a multiprofessional task force (including nursing, 
service users, physicians, physiotherapy and psychology) and formal multistep 
procedures to reach a set of consensus recommendations. The clinical practice 
recommendations were reviewed by five external reviewers from North America and 
Europe and were also posted for public comment.
RESULTS: The key clinical practice recommendations suggest: (a) first optimizing 
established non-pharmacological treatments and non-opioid analgesics and (b) 
considering opioid treatment if established non-pharmacological treatments or 
non-opioid analgesics are not effective and/or not tolerated and/or 
contraindicated. Evidence- and clinical consensus-based potential indications 
and contraindications for opioid treatment are presented. Eighteen GCP 
recommendations give guidance regarding clinical evaluation, as well as opioid 
treatment assessment, monitoring, continuation and discontinuation.
CONCLUSIONS: Opioids remain a treatment option for some selected patients with 
CNCP under careful surveillance.
SIGNIFICANCE: In chronic pain, opioids are neither a universal cure nor a 
universally dangerous weapon. They should only be used for some selected chronic 
noncancer pain syndromes if established non-pharmacological and pharmacological 
treatment options have failed in supervised pain patients as part of a 
comprehensive, multi-modal, multi-disciplinary approach to treatment. In this 
context alone, opioid therapy can be a useful tool in achieving and maintaining 
an optimal level of pain control in some patients.

BACKGROUND: Occipital nerve stimulation (ONS) has been proposed to treat 
refractory chronic cluster headache (rCCH) but its efficacy has only been showed 
in small short-term series.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate ONS long-term efficacy in rCCH.
METHODS: We studied 105 patients with rCCH, treated by ONS within a multicenter 
ONS prospective registry. Efficacy was evaluated by frequency, intensity of pain 
attacks, quality of life (QoL) EuroQol 5 dimensions (EQ5D), functional (Headache 
Impact Test-6, Migraine Disability Assessment) and emotional (Hospital Anxiety 
Depression Scale [HAD]) impacts, and medication consumption.
RESULTS: At last follow-up (mean 43.8 mo), attack frequency was reduced >50% in 
69% of the patients. Mean weekly attack frequency decreased from 22.5 at 
baseline to 9.9 (P < .001) after ONS. Preventive and abortive medications were 
significantly decreased. Functional impact, anxiety, and QoL significantly 
improved after ONS. In excellent responders (59% of the patients), attack 
frequency decreased by 80% and QoL (EQ5D visual analog scale) dramatically 
improved from 37.8/100 to 73.2/100. When comparing baseline and 1-yr and last 
follow-up outcomes, efficacy was sustained over time. In multivariable analysis, 
low preoperative HAD-depression score was correlated to a higher risk of ONS 
failure. During the follow-up, 67 patients experienced at least one 
complication, 29 requiring an additional surgery: infection (6%), lead migration 
(12%) or fracture (4.5%), hardware dysfunction (8.2%), and local pain (20%).
CONCLUSION: Our results showed that long-term efficacy of ONS in CCH was 
maintained over time. In responders, ONS induced a major reduction of functional 
and emotional headache-related impacts and a dramatic improvement of QoL. These 
results obtained in real-life conditions support its use and dissemination in 
rCCH patients.

OBJECTIVES: Due to the impact of COVID-19 epidemic, face-to-face follow-up 
treatments for patients with chronic pain and implanted spinal cord stimulation 
(SCS) devices are forced to be delayed or stopped. This has led to more follow 
ups being done remotely. Meanwhile, with the development of 4G/5G networks, 
smartphones, and novel devices, remote programming has become possible. Here, we 
investigated the demand and utility of remote follow-ups including remote 
programming for SCS for patients with chronic pain.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A questionnaire including questions on demographic 
characteristics, pain history, postimplantation life quality, standard follow-up 
experience, remote follow-up, and remote programming experience was sent to 
patients diagnosed as chronic intractable pain and treated with SCS during 
January 2019 to January 2020.
RESULTS: A total of 64 participants completed the questionnaire. About 70% of 
participants expressed demands for remote follow-ups due to the inconvenience, 
high costs, and time consumption of traditional follow-up visits. Nearly 97% of 
participants have attempted remote follow-ups, and about 81% of participants 
have further tried remote programming. Approximately, 96% of them recognized the 
benefits.
CONCLUSIONS: The remote programming was in high demand among participants. Most 
of the participants have tried remote follow-ups or even remote programming. The 
remote programming appeared to be more efficient, economic and were widely 
recognized among participants.

BACKGROUND: Opioid use for chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) is under debate. In 
the absence of pan-European guidance on this issue, a position paper was 
commissioned by the European Pain Federation (EFIC).
METHODS: The clinical practice recommendations were developed by eight 
scientific societies and one patient self-help organization under the 
coordination of EFIC. A systematic literature search in MEDLINE (up until 
January 2020) was performed. Two categories of guidance are given: 
Evidence-based recommendations (supported by evidence from systematic reviews of 
randomized controlled trials or of observational studies) and Good Clinical 
Practice (GCP) statements (supported either by indirect evidence or by 
case-series, case-control studies and clinical experience). The GRADE system was 
applied to move from evidence to recommendations. The recommendations and GCP 
statements were developed by a multiprofessional task force (including nursing, 
service users, physicians, physiotherapy and psychology) and formal multistep 
procedures to reach a set of consensus recommendations. The clinical practice 
recommendations were reviewed by five external reviewers from North America and 
Europe and were also posted for public comment.
RESULTS: The European Clinical Practice Recommendations give guidance for 
combination with other medications, the management of frequent (e.g. nausea, 
constipation) and rare (e.g. hyperalgesia) side effects, for special clinical 
populations (e.g. children and adolescents, pregnancy) and for special 
situations (e.g. liver cirrhosis).
CONCLUSION: If a trial with opioids for chronic noncancer pain is conducted, 
detailed knowledge and experience are needed to adapt the opioid treatment to a 
special patient group and/or clinical situation and to manage side effects 
effectively.
SIGNIFICANCE: If a trial with opioids for chronic noncancer pain is conducted, 
detailed knowledge and experience are needed to adapt the opioid treatment to a 
special patient group and/or clinical situation and to manage side effects 
effectively. A collaboration of medical specialties and of all health care 
professionals is needed for some special populations and clinical situations.

Delayed neurocognitive recovery and postoperative neurocognitive disorders are 
major complications of surgery, hospitalization, and anesthesia that are 
receiving increasing attention. Their incidence is reported to be 10-80% after 
cardiac surgery and 10-26% after non-cardiac surgery. Some of the risk factors 
include advanced age, level of education, history of diabetes mellitus, 
malnutrition, perioperative hyperglycemia, depth of anesthesia, blood pressure 
fluctuation during surgery, chronic respiratory diseases, etc. Scientific 
evidence suggests a causal association between anesthesia and delayed 
neurocognitive recovery or postoperative neurocognitive disorders, and various 
pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed: mitochondrial dysfunction, 
neuroinflammation, increase in tau protein phosphorylation, accumulation of 
amyloid-β protein, etc. Insulin receptors in the central nervous system have a 
non-metabolic role and act through a neuromodulator-like action, while an 
interaction between anesthetics and central nervous system insulin receptors 
might contribute to anesthesia-induced delayed neurocognitive recovery or 
postoperative neurocognitive disorders. Acute or chronic intranasal insulin 
administration, which has no influence on the blood glucose concentration, 
appears to improve working memory, verbal fluency, attention, recognition of 
objects, etc., in animal models, cognitively healthy humans, and memory-impaired 
patients by restoring the insulin receptor signaling pathway, attenuating 
anesthesia-induced tau protein hyperphosphorylation, etc. The aim of this review 
is to report preclinical and clinical evidence of the implication of intranasal 
insulin for preventing changes in the brain molecular pattern and/or 
neurobehavioral impairment, which influence anesthesia-induced delayed 
neurocognitive recovery or postoperative neurocognitive disorders.

BACKGROUND: Migraine is a primary headache disorder that can be classified into 
an episodic (EM) and a chronic form (CM). Network analysis within the 
graph-theoretical framework based on connectivity patterns provides an approach 
to observe large-scale structural integrity. We test the hypothesis that 
migraineurs are characterized by a segregated network.
METHODS: 19 healthy controls (HC), 17 EM patients and 12 CM patients were 
included. Cortical thickness and subcortical volumes were computed, and topology 
was analyzed using a graph theory analytical framework and network-based 
statistics. We further used support vector machines regression (SVR) to identify 
whether these network measures were able to predict clinical parameters.
RESULTS: Network based statistics revealed significantly lower interregional 
connectivity strength between anatomical compartments including the 
fronto-temporal, parietal and visual areas in EM and CM when compared to HC. 
Higher assortativity was seen in both patients' group, with higher modularity 
for CM and higher transitivity for EM compared to HC. For subcortical networks, 
higher assortativity and transitivity were observed for both patients' group 
with higher modularity for CM. SVR revealed that network measures could robustly 
predict clinical parameters for migraineurs.
CONCLUSION: We found global network disruption for EM and CM indicated by highly 
segregated network in migraine patients compared to HC. Higher modularity but 
lower clustering coefficient in CM is suggestive of more segregation in this 
group compared to EM. The presence of a segregated network could be a sign of 
maladaptive reorganization of headache related brain circuits, leading to 
migraine attacks or secondary alterations to pain.

Transient receptor potential vanilloids (TRPV1) are non-selective cation 
channels that sense and transduce inflammatory pain signals. We previously 
reported that activation of TRPV1 induced the translocation of β-arrestin2 
(ARRB2) from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, raising questions about the 
functional role of ARRB2 in the nucleus. Here, we determined the ARRB2 nuclear 
signalosome by conducting a quantitative proteomic analysis of the 
nucleus-sequestered L395Q ARRB2 mutant, compared to the cytosolic wild-type 
ARRB2 (WT ARRB2), in a heterologous expression system. We identified clusters of 
proteins that localize to the nucleolus and are involved in ribosomal 
biogenesis. Accordingly, L395Q ARRB2 or WT ARRB2 after capsaicin treatment were 
found to co-localize and interact with the nucleolar marker nucleophosmin 
(NPM1), treacle protein (TCOF1) and RNA polymerase I (POL I). We further 
investigated the role of nuclear ARRB2 signaling in regulating neuroplasticity. 
Using neuroblastoma (neuro2a) cells and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons, we 
found that L395Q ARRB2 mutant increased POL I activity, inhibited the tumor 
suppressorp53 (p53) level and caused a decrease in the outgrowth of neurites. 
Together, our results suggest that the activation of TRPV1 promotes the 
ARRB2-mediated regulation of ribosomal biogenesis in the nucleolus. The 
ARRB2-TCOF1-p53 checkpoint signaling pathway might be involved in regulating 
neurite outgrowth associated with pathological pain conditions.

Increasingly, refined virtual reality (VR) techniques allow for the simultaneous 
and coherent stimulation of multiple sensory and motor domains. In some clinical 
interventions, such as those related to spinal cord injuries (SCIs), the impact 
of VR on people's multisensory perception, movements, attitudes, and even 
modulations of socio-cognitive aspects of their behavior may influence every 
phase of their rehabilitation treatment, from the acute to chronic stages. This 
work describes the potential advantages of using first-person-perspective VR to 
treat SCIs and its implications for manipulating sensory-motor feedback to alter 
body signals. By situating a patient with SCI in a virtual environment, 
sensorial perceptions and motor intention can be enriched into a more coherent 
bodily experience that also promotes processes of neural regeneration and 
plasticity. In addition to the great potential of research, the most significant 
areas of interest concern is managing neuropathic pain, motor rehabilitation, 
and psychological well-being.
